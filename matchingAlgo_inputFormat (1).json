When living in London, we came through various experience, so we decided to capture feelings of different stages of our life in London in a theatre production. We were able to give voice to numerous Europeans migrating between their home countries and United Kingdom. We revealed stories that often stay hidden under the mask of a hardworking lifestyle. People of different nationalities approached us after one of our first stage shows and encouraged us to continue showing what is the real cost of abandoning the home country, although within the supposed familiar European context. Our finished production was delivered in April 2016 and we have performed five times since then. As volunteers, we do not expect to make money for what we do but we would like to balance our investments with the incomme/donations. Because of the topic MIGRANTS´ RHAPSODY being so generally resonating with European countries, we found audiences both in UK and abroad. That added an extra cost to our travel expenses. With your help, we will be able to continue performing.  Sme mladí ľudia zo Slovenska, žijúci v Londýne. Máme pozitívny vzťah k umeniu a k divadlu zvlášť, preto sme súčasťou dobrovoľného divadelného združenia SLOVENSKÉ KOMUNITNÉ DIVADLO V LONDÝNE. Pred takmer dvoma rokmi sme sa rozhodli zachytiť v divadelnej hre všetko, čo sme zažili počas našej londýnskej Odysey. Výsledkom našich snáh sa stala jedinečná, sedemdesiatminútová divadelná hra Migrantská rapsódia. Diváci z rozličných európskych krajín za nami prichádzali po predstavení prvej verzie hry a presviedčali nás o tom, že máme pokračovať, pretože zobrazujeme skúsenosť, ktorá spája všetkých presídlencov bez výnimky. Rozhodli sme sa teda hru sprístupniť komukoľvek a naskúšali sme ju v oboch jazykoch - v slovenčine aj v angličtine. Od apríla 2016 hráme pre britských aj zahraničných divákov, krajanov aj medzinárodné obecenstvo. Ako nezisková skupina neočakávame viac, než návrat nákladov, no kvôli cestovaniu sa naše investície do projektu mierne navýšili. Preto aktivujeme verejnú zbierku. Svojím príspevkom podporíte nielen šírenie súčasného umenia, ale aj tvorivosť a kultúrnu reprezentáciu Slovákov, žijúcich v zahraničí.

Infectious/was written by Meghan Leslie in response to many topical stories she had read/around the suggestion of there being a future potential for humans, to become/resistant to antibiotics. Scary! The writing process began through exploring these/questions; what would you do if you couldn't touch another person? Couldn't kiss another person? What would society/look like if humans were no longer immune to certain fatal viruses? How would we live? Who would we love? With Ebola in 2014, the/people in Sierra Leone are now following the “don’t touch rule.” What would this be like in a contemporary society/if people couldn't touch, if they couldn't hug, fight, or kiss? What would our/communities look like over time, how would they act? Through the development/and performance of this play, Welded Theatre aims to explore this idea with the/help of a group of diverse actors that include professional actors originally/from Slovenia, Ireland, and Canada. We hope to achieve engagement with our/actors and audience, by immersing them into this play and our unique artistic/processes. Allowing the audience to see exactly what their near future might/look like.The play has been picked up by The Wardrobe Theatre in Bristol and programmed into their Spring Season brochure. The Wardrobe Theatre is a very respected performance space that is known for supporting up and coming companies like ours within the region. Their website gets about 3000 visits per month and they are cross promoters for larger theatre houses like The Bristol Old Vic. Welded Theatre is committed to providing/accessible and affordable theatre arts events to it audiences by setting/realistic guidelines for our financial future. By following our personal code/of financial conduct, we will set realistic budgets for ourselves on each/production. For the production of Infectious/we have managed to keep our costs as low as possible, without sacrificing our artistic goals. This where you come in.The founding members of Welded Theatre have independently given over a set amount money as a start up for the theatre company. What we need from you is a little support in kind to add extra coins to our pockets to reach our maximum funding goal for this production.This money will go towards all the bits and pieces from which we will build this production. You will literally be buying items such as- a few cups of tea and lunch during the rehearsals for the cast, or a few more lighting gels to help with our lighting design, extra time in a rehearsal space, cleaning products, a costume, extra pieces of set, or a free ticket to the show for a student.   To find out more about our company and background please visit: http://www.weldedtheatre.com/","risks and challenges":"There are always risks and challenges with anything, especially when it comes to the performance arts. Government budget cuts to the arts for one thing! Welded Theatre was formed with a clear artistic code of ethos (please see our website) in order to survive in this economic climate and to allow us be able to bring our artistry to the public. Infectious, is our first play that will be produced professionally in conjunction with a major theatre house. This is our moment to put everything we have learned, practiced, and experienced to the test./We believe so much in this project that we chose Kickstarter for its \"all or nothing rule\" Edmund & Meghan ARE ALL IN on this project, and so we are asking you to join us to. We have to reach the total pledge goal in order to receive any of the pledge./Here is a little bit of background information from our production manager who will be overseeing all of our income and expenditure; just so you know who will be handling your pledges./Over the last 8 years Edmund McKay has been freelancing as Production Manager for the Arts. The projects he has managed ranged in budgets from £3,000-£20,000; for art organisations such as Earthfall Dance, Kompany Malakhi and Moving Dust. Alongside his freelance work within the arts sector, he is also frequently employed as a back office accountant, billing specialist, bank reconciliation expert, within the private and financial sector. He will be using this vast knowledge to manage the budget for Infectious. /The budget for Infectious will be tracked on a spreadsheet using formulas that automatically update the running balance as and when new data is keyed. For a project this size he will ring fence of 5% of the overall budget and will make it available only in the last few days prior to opening night for the show. In his experience it is this period where unexpected costs occur through technical and dress rehearsals./Currently we are waiting for our business to complete its registration with the banks and UK Companies House. For the time being, we are asking donations to be sent to the individual, Meghan Leslie McKay (Founder & Artistic Director of Welded Theatre)/Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"infectious-love-at-the-end-of-the-21st-century","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"694.612737","backers_count":15,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":1699867,"background_color":null,"project_id":1699867,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1425915893,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/034/187/ec331c0b09450d44ee790aacbec6cb12_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463725881&auto=format&q=92&s=393579ef0f43fab03fdf6bd039ece7c5","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/034/187/ec331c0b09450d44ee790aacbec6cb12_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463725881&auto=format&q=92&s=393579ef0f43fab03fdf6bd039ece7c5"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Innovative Theatre Company Needs You To Reach Funding Requirements.

A Caregiver?My goal is to help others navigate their way through the rough waters of caregiving so that they can become fearless, ask questions, trust their instincts and find humor in almost any situation. Even changing an adult diaper. Really? Really. Then, my book received the Gold Medal Winner from the Living/Now Book Awards, and the Caregiver Friendly Award from Today’s Caregiver.  I stiil wanted to reach out to others.

This Year ... I Have a Headache: a comedy about marriage","info":{"description":"Testimonials from the future ...\"I laughed so hard, I almost spit out a kidney.\"\"I can't wait to go home, kiss my wife. She is wonderful. I'm a lucky man.\"\"I am baffled and amazed that these guys somehow wrote a fun and fantastic play about marriage without once cursing.\"IN A NUTSHELL ...Steve Shaffer and Mark Schiff have pooled their comedic perspectives and written a play about love and tolerance, annoyance and acceptance, family and diplomacy, and commitment. Yes, it's about marriage. After three years of staged readings, rewrites, tinkering, testing, and perfecting - it's ready to open for a six-week \"engagement\" in a Los Angeles theater. This Kickstarter is to help fund that engagement.ABOUT THE PLAYNot This Year ... I Have a Headache examines the lives of two middle-aged married couples who are dealing with the modern struggles of an age-old institution. Through their trials, tribulations, and banter, the audience will (hopefully) laugh, cry (actually, not really cry - pretty much just laugh), and maybe even gain insight. Because this play, while a comedy, also reveals realistic pathways for confronting and navigating complex issues, many of which we can all identify with ... like religious differences, gay marriage, and divorce. Our characters use humor to learn plausible ways to renew love and enhance acceptance. This play is cheaper than therapy, and works better than Cialis.///This image from the first-ever reading of the play///ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGNSteve and Mark have been friends for decades, they have been stand-up performers and comedy writers for decades, and they have each been married for decades. Basically, everything they do, they do for decades. ///Left: Nancy and Mark Schiff; Right: Gretchen and Steve Shaffer///They are both big fans of the theater, and have long harbored dreams of producing a comedic play that would combine laughter and life lessons. They know and feel they understand the topic of marriage. They wrote Not This Year ... I Have a Headache as a true collaboration. They did test readings, private readings, table readings, and psychic readings. There has already been interest and kind words from many, including esteemed Theater Director and Choreographer Jonathan Cerullo, who sits on the selection committee for the prestigious Joseph A. Callaway Award.

Where it goes from there is anybody's guess. THE \"MARRIAGE\" BETWEEN MARRIAGE & COMEDY///Great comic marriages  Stiller & Meara, Wilder & Radner, and (on-screen) Archie & Edith///\"Marriage is a wonderful institution. But who wants to live in an institution?\" - Groucho MarxThe origin of marriage is not precisely known, but it is known that the tradition of exchanging rings dates back to Ancient Egypt. The origin of comedy is believed to date back to the discovery of the wheel, when one caveman rolled his wheel over another caveman's foot. The longest marriage ever recorded was 91 years, 12 days, but hey - they got married young. When married couples laugh together (that's laugh together, not laugh at each other), they do tend to find greater contentment in life, and live longer. We're doing our part. ///Great modern marriages: Melinda & Bill Gates, Mary Matalin & James Carville, and Marge & Homer////\"Laughter is the best medicine.\" - AnonymousComedy is one of very few things we have in this world that is addictive in a good way. It relieves stress, and improves disposition. It can also educate and heal. Good sarcasm can make one ponder ideas and viewpoints beyond their own. Marriage not only benefits from comedy, it practically requires it. And who better to write a comedy than comedians?Says Steve: Comedians are a fraternity. I have never looked back at my choice of career partly because I love that kinship with other comedians. Our friendships often last. There's mutual respect. It's good. Adds Mark: We're entertainers. We write and perform. Mostly, we write about what we know. We always need new material, so we accumulate \"knowledge\". This is why so many comedians win Nobel Prizes. ///Mark, w Larry Miller, Paul Reiser, and Jerry Seinfeld - like a scene from Diner//////LEFT: Steve w Jon Hayman and Dan Rosen at Hayman's Bar Mitzvah; RIGHT: Steve with Joe Bolster, Wayne Federman, Patty Rosborough, and Jim Mendrinos/// \"Love is blind; marriage is the eye-opener.\" - Pauline Thomason////Classic marriages - Ozzie & Harriet, Lucy & Desi, Ozzy & Sharon///Stats prove that marriage is hard. You gotta want it. You gotta always remember why you chose this person for an eternity (or what seems like one). You gotta communicate. And ... you gotta laugh.  ///Historic marriages - JFK & Jackie, Rachel & Jackie Robinson, Ellen & Portia///MEET THE CHARACTERS////L to R: Rick Overton, Monica Piper, Avi Liberman, and Barb Heller. They did the table reads for us last month. How lucky we are to have friends like these!!!///Henry - Henry is the bighearted, hard-working, high school football coach, married to Cookie. He also teaches American history and while he has great respect for the subject, he'd rather be coaching. Sometimes he seems simple, but he's capable of sensitive insight.  New societal standards are clouding his moral judgment (shaped by a Catholic upbringing). His son is gay and getting married. Henry has the bumpiest road to travel. Although his path is uncertain, he keeps moving forward, one step at a time. You will recognize him as someone you know. Cookie – Cookie is a firecracker - tough, smart, funny, curious, and caustic. She’s a high school guidance counselor which works for her because she longs to be needed. She loves to stick her nose in anything, with a strong opinion that she won't hesitate to voice. She harbors a secret dream to someday be a relationship therapist.  She's married to Henry, loves him dearly, but is challenged by what she feels is his narrow-mindedness. She feels he’s gone from cute and quirky, to overweight and frustrating. But she wants the marriage to continue, because after all… love is love. Jake – Jake is a high school English teacher with a keen sense of humor, married to Aviva. He is erudite, cool, and bright but not a nerdy intellectual type. He is confident but never arrogant. He finds the simplicity and directness of his best friend, Henry, to be refreshing. He confides in Henry because he knows he’ll always get an honest answer. He’s a liberal Jew and a loyal friend, proud of Aviva and the religious sacrifice she made to be with him. He reads The New York Times for news, but also reads the New York Post because it has a better sports section. Aviva  - Aviva is a high school librarian, married to Jake. She is intelligent and academic, but also modest and easily embarrassed. She is delightfully quirky, loving, considerate person, often quiet and a simple voice of reason.  She can appear complicated. Aviva was raised in an orthodox Jewish home and felt she had to abandon many of her religious practices in order to marry Jake.  Resentments have been building up inside of her, and thanks to this play, she’ll have the opportunity to express them. MEET THE TEAMMARK SCHIFF///L to R: Mark w Paul Reiser; Mark w Jerry Seinfeld; Mark w a good book///Mark Schiff is a stand-up comedian, comedy writer, performer, and author. He recently toured with Jerry Seinfeld in Tel Aviv. He has had comedy specials on Showtime and HBO, and appeared on The Tonight Show and Late Night with David Letterman. His first play The Comic ran for 10 months in LA and was optioned by HBO for a film. He feels Not This Year, I Have a Headache is his finest work, and he's basically OK with carrying his old friend Shaffer along for the ride. ///L to R: Mark & wife at home; Mark & wife on bridge; Mark & wife in jail///STEVE SHAFFER///L to R: Steve w George Cariln; Steve w wife getting married; Steve w Jerry and Pete Barbuti///Steve Shaffer is a stand-up comedian, Ace Award-winning writer, and actor in film, TV, and commercials. He has toured with George Carlin, opened for The Beach Boys, and been a recurring character on Murphy Brown. He has appeared on The Tonight Show, Merv Griffin, Evening at the Improv, and Comedy Central. He has taught comedy at The New School. He feels Not This Year, I Have a Headache is his finest work, and he's basically OK with carrying his old friend Schiff along for the ride. ///L to R: Steve all smiles; Steve w Steve Hytner (Kenny Bania); Steve reacting to your pledge///HENRY SHAFFER///L to R: Henry in a pose; Henry the athlete; Henry in his natural state///Henry Shaffer attended Penn State, and studied film at The College of New Jersey. He currently freelances as an event photographer and videographer. He has strong video editing skills, as evidenced by this campaign's Project Video (above). TIMELINE, BUDGET, AND USE OF PROCEEDSTIMELINE: we believe the following estimated timeline to be reasonable: the Kickstarter concludes and settles in Mid-May; casting calls and rehearsals begin in June, continue through July. The play either launches in either August or October, 2016.BUDGET: we believe the pie chart below to be a reasonable estimation of what expenses are incurred and in what proportion. Upon success of Kickstarter, depending upon the degree of success, the budget will be fine-tuned. Overage monies will inure entirely to production, with perhaps a small amount toward marketing./////WHY KICKSTARTERSays Mark - \"Like I said in the video, we came to Kickstarter for three reasons. (Four, including us needing the money.) First is Independence - we wrote this play from personal experience, and only if we are independent producers of the play can we be assured that the play will continue as an extension of those experiences. Second reason is Truth. We don't want to bow to pressure to avoid or tiptoe around topics, we want to present a truthful picture through believable characters, and convey that truth through comedy. In this way, while you laugh, maybe you learn. Finally, Collaboration. Writing with Steve has been a joyful collaboration. Producing this will be a larger collaboration. Marriage is always a collaboration. And we can't imagine a better place for such a collaborative venture than Kickstarter, where the power of collaboration is proven every day.\"NOTES ABOUT THE REWARDSORDERING MORE THAN TWO TICKETS: No problem. Pick the reward that applies to the ticket type you desire. Select it. Go to the next screen. On this screen, you can go to the top where it has a dollar amount, and change the dollar amount. Keep the same reward selection, just change the dollar amount to account for the number of tickets you would like. Then complete the transaction, and send us a message through Kickstarter of what you did by clicking CONTACT ME on the top right of the campaign page. Any questions, not to worry, we'll walk u through it. DELIVERY DATES: The delivery date of January 2017 reflects the outside date when the play will be performed, professionally captured, produced, and available. Many other Rewards will be fulfilled earlier, but since the play is a part of all rewards levels, we went with January 2017.CHOICES: All \"choices\" involved in any Reward tiers (t-shirt size, DVD or Blu- Ray, etc.) will be made after the campaign, on the Kickstarter survey form. / CUSTOM COMBOS:  If there are Rewards you'd like that are not available in quite the exact combo or quantity you prefer - send an email to the Project Creators by clicking \"CONTACT ME\" on the upper right; of course, we'll be glad to work it out.","risks and challenges":"Steve and Mark are longtime writers and performers with substantial experience in production. They have done a great deal of preparation prior to launching this campaign, including locating several interested theaters. Both men are prepared to jump into the production of this play as their primary projects. Their wives are ecstatic with this as it will keep them out of the house more. Although the production of any play has a great many moving parts, this is mitigated here as this play benefits from a small cast, and limited sets and set changes. Steve and Mark can therefore say with absolute certainty that if the Kickstarter succeeds, the play will be performed, and the Rewards will be delivered as scheduled./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"not-this-year-i-have-a-headache-a-comedy-about-mar","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"31820.5","backers_count":237,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":2196026,"background_color":null,"project_id":2196026,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1445960511,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/290/666/583e8f94d2f6d36e3ce079026492e17d_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&v=1463751832&auto=format&q=92&s=1efd3b31f6abfe904ab901efa9aa7a94","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/290/666/583e8f94d2f6d36e3ce079026492e17d_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&v=1463751832&auto=format&q=92&s=1efd3b31f6abfe904ab901efa9aa7a94"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Two long-time pals, comedy veterans, have written a hilarious new play.

We broke our budget down to the bare minimum of what it will take to get this work put up here in Manhattan.  We have removed set pieces, changed certain elements of the show, and called in favors.  Your help in backing this new effort will get us up on the stage.  Our previous efforts were for both the Manhattan show and the Atlanta Show.  We decided to start where we are and if you back us today we can make it to the Manhattan StageHOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO REVISIT THE PAST? In \"3 Days In Savannah,\" we find out. The play has been selected to appear in the Summer  2014 New Works Series at Manhattan Repertory Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City! Manhattan Repertory Theatre is a forum for playwrights, directors, and actors to share their work.  I am so honored and excited that I can barely think.  As a young playwright this is such a wonderful surprise but our creative team needs your help to make it to 42nd street. The goal of this kickstarter is to fund the workshop presentation of the show in New York City at Manhattan Repertory and to ultimately bring a World Premiere of this work to Atlanta, Georgia.The story follows our two lead characters, Emme and Mason, as they navigate the secrets of their past.  There are some very talented people behind the play. We are raising funds to be able to provide for costumes, lighting, sound, rehearsal space, props, original music, dramaturgy services, programs, marketing materials, professional services, theatre deposits, and advertising for the show.  If we get fully funded we will be able to present a quality work of theatre on the Manhattan stage July 29-August 01. It would be an honor to present this work and to tell their story.  The original music of 3 Days is enchanting.  The play is full of humor and heartache.  We have an amazing cast that is ready to share this story with the audience. We are all teaching artists, working actors, small business owners, and friends who love to create! This is New York City, so production costs are astronomical. We want to create a quality presentation. The story is one that deals with issues of love, racism, colorism, betrayal, and heartbreak. We believe that it is a universal story","risks and challenges":"Our major challenge is time. The show is set to open at the end of July and we need to utilize all the time we have to rehearse.  Rehearsal space in New York is very expensive. It can range from $30 per hour to $150.  This is New York City, so production costs are astronomical. We have to pay for professional services, and create major buzz in the form of marketing the show. We want to create a quality presentation. The story is one that deals with universal issues. We believe that it will be well received but in order to tell this story in a way that makes the most impact we need to use lights, sound cues, costumes, and props. All of which cost money. There are some brilliant minds behind the creation of this work. The playwright, Miranda Childers, enlisted the help of professional choreographers, dramaturgs, and costume designers to create the overall aesthetic of the play. In total over 20 people will be putting in many hours to make this project work. The major challenges also include securing the rights to music that is not original and securing standard contracts for professional services.

Design by Georgia HicksVideos by Hunter Allen/————————————————————Blurb/Jestia and Raedon are perfect for each other. Whatʼs more, they’ve been given a luxurious house to live in, three weeks to get to know one another, and the blazing adoration of millions of people around the world. But thereʼs only one catch: theyʼre about to enter the most difficult, world-renowned and life-changing gameshow ever created./Promises made. Pacts broken. Fear. Freedom. Romance. Love!/Previous praise:/'You know a show’s good when you never want it to end. Ever.’ ★★★★★ Three Weeks/————————————————————Our StoryThe Edinburgh Fringe is a notoriously difficult place to put on new plays as you're competing with (quite literally) thousands of other shows. Theatre, in particular, is a hard sell, especially since much of the festival now leans towards more traditional comedy such as stand up and sketch acts.We're a young theatre company fresh out of Cambridge, looking to work professionally in the roles we're taking on in this show. Funding is very difficult to access when you're starting out in theatre - which is why we've turned to kickstarter.However, as a group we're confident we can make this a great run at the Fringe. Together, we have experience of over 7 full fringe runs, and a combined portfolio of over 100 shows. We know how to work hard, how to advertise and how to get people in. Basically, we're totally willing to put in the time and the effort to get our show to reach as many people as possible. We can't wait to get started!The Team//////Lowell Belfield was Social  Secretary of the Cambridge Footlights 2011-12, where he wrote and performed in over ten comedy shows and plays. Since then he has taken his two-man musical comedy show ‘I am, I am’ to the Gilded Balloon, subsequently performing in the finals of the Musical Comedy Awards 2012, on the London comedy circuit and at the BBC comedy stages. His last show, the sketch show ‘PICK ME UP’, performed in London’s Hen and Chickens before going on to Just the Tonic, Edinburgh 2014, where it garnered rave reviews and won the Derek Award for Best Show. As social secretary of the Cambridge Footlights, he won the Cambridge Union’s Comedy Smoker with his debut comic performance in 2010. Since then he has written and performed in critically acclaimed sketch shows ‘Now, Now’, ‘PICK ME UP’, as well as two sell- out Footlights Spring Revues (‘The star man is Lowell Belfield’ - Varsity). In 2010 he performed alongside his friend and writing partner Harry Michell in the sold-out Footlights Harry Porter Prize nominated comic play ‘To Have And To Hold’ at St. Augustines, Edinburgh (***** -EdFringeReview), and in 2012 he debated the cast of ‘Made in Chelsea’ in the packed-out Cambridge Union, thoroughly winning the debate and defeating his Olly Locke-led opponents./////Andy Brock trained at E15 Acting School before attending Cambridge University where he performed with the Cambridge Footlights as well as appearing in the world famous Cambridge Greek Play. He also  performed in the 2012 Marlowe Society Showcase in London’s West End, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. As a director his focus is on new writing and devised work. He has directed Bereavement:The Musical, which performed at C Venues in Edinburgh 2012, which was nominated for Best New Musical in the 2012 Musical Theatre Matters Awards; the critically acclaimed devised play Babushka at C Venues in Edinburgh 2012, and most recently The Tales of the Ancholme Valley which he devised with his award winning theatre company, Troupe. /////Sarah Livingstone is an actor living in London. She has performed in an American Stage Tour of Shakespeare’s ‘Measure for Measure’, as part of CAST 2013, which returned to tour Britain receiving rave reviews and selling out both British and American legs of the tour. She has played the title roles in ‘[Lady] Hamlet’ at the ADC Theatre, as Alcestis in Ted Hughes’s ‘Alcestis’ at the ADC Theatre and as Electra in ‘The Complex: Oedipus + Electra’ by Mourkogiannis, Williams, and Lowenthal at The Space in Edinburgh 2012.As well as this she has performed in over fifteen plays including: ’The Other Line’ by Hellie Cranney & Ellen Robertson; ‘Blue Stockings’ by Jessica Swale, as Maeve Sullivan; in the ADC/Footlights Pantomime 2013:The Princess and the Pea by Ben Pope, Ryan Ammar and Hellie Cranney; in ‘The Deep Blue Sea’ by Terence Rattigan; ‘The Rose Tattoo’ by Tennessee Williams; and ‘The Seventh Seal’ by Ingmar Bergman (all at the ADC Theatre)./////Archie Henderson-Cleland is a member of Cambridge Footlights 2014-15, and has performed in and written numerous productions at the University. Recent theatre includes The Golden Fleece, by Ryan Ammar; Footlights Presents: Dumpf, which he also co-wrote; and STIFF!, by Sam Grabiner (all at the ADC theatre). Archie is also a stand-up comedian and has performed in numerous stand-up shows and smokers in Cambridge. Archie is a saxophonist and plays with Cambridge band Lorelai. /////Rachel Hunter produced the hugely successful comedy sketch show ‘PICK ME UP’, which performed a critically acclaimed run at Just the Tonic in Edinburgh 2013, eventually winning the Derek Award for Best Fringe Show. The show also did a tour of schools, Cambridge and London, all of which sold out. Rachel has been involved in seven shows at university and beyond, producing a sold out run of Jessica Swale’s ‘Blue Stockings’ at the ADC Theatre; ‘bash’ by Neil Labute, and new writing ‘Did You Say No Though’, both of which performed at Corpus Playroom. She is also an organiser of feminist events such as the ‘Women in Academia’ panel discussion she put together in January 2014./////James Hansen produced this year's sell-out Footlights Spring Revue, 'The History of Everything', which opened to universal critical acclaim at the ADC Theatre. He also produced 'Welcome Break' at the ADC, a new comic play by Footlight Alex MacKeith, which garnered rave reviews - 'immensely entertaining... truly intelligent comedy' (***** Cambridge Theatre Review), 'there aren't enough superlatives' (**** Cambridge Tab) and several sold out nights. Following Edinburgh, James will head to the USA, tour several English schools and then return to Cambridge with The Footlights International Tour Show 2014, 'Real Feelings', having stage-managed a sold-out run of the 2013 CUADC/Footlights Pantomime, 'The Princess & the Pea'. James has worked on 13 shows at university and beyond, including the critically acclaimed and sold-out 'Ivanov', 'Three Sisters', 'The Deep Blue Sea', and 'ENRON', (***** Varsity, Cambridge Tab, CTR) all at the ADC Theatre. He also produced music for Emmanuel May Ball in 2013.","risks and challenges":"We've been to many fringes between us and are accustomed to the kinds of obstacles we're expected to face. We already have our slot at C Venues, our publicity designed and a publicity plan in place. As the main obstacle at the Fringe is getting our show noticed, and appealing to word of mouth, we've arranged London previews as a way of getting our show out and seen before the festival itself. /There is difficulty with finding technical teams when you're a new creative project, as the cost of this can often be high.

by Louise Page. A play about Breast Cancer.","info":{"description":"Tissue is a Play about breast cancer, it follows the journey of Sally as she goes through the ups and downs and the support she recieves from facing this terrifiying path that lays ahead of her.This will be an immersive piece of theatre with the audience genuinely feeling what Sally has to go through. using a mixture of multimedia, set pieces and surrealism. i hope to not only create an entertaining piece of theatre but also a complete understanding of what these women go through or in fact anyone that has to face the possibilty of dying or having to drastically change their life.My reasons for doing this are quite simple. i work as a nursing assistant as my \"resting\" Job, so i come in contact with situations like this all the time and see how it can affect not only the patient, but also the friends, familiy and even the staff.I have an ability to create theatre and the experiences of an acute medical ward, so why not marry the two and do something positive whilst entertaining as well.Utilising local facilities, some amazing professional actors and with a lot of support, this 8 performance one act play will be something special and thought provoking... leaving people with a better understanding of breast cancer so they will donate as much as they can towards the building of a new breast cancer unit in the city of Salisbury.","risks and challenges":"One of the main risks are the use of multi media, as technology is always a gamble to rely on during a live performance, you never know what will happen (just look at Madonna!!!)/So i wont be relying on it as a device to further the narrative, but more a condiment to help the flavour of the scene./Rehearsals and venues is proving to be a difficulty, in getting everyone in the same room at the same time, providing a decent area to rehearse and keeping cost low. but with some research and explanation of the content of the play and why we are doing it, we're finding more and more people willing to help./I'm also on the look out for decent accommodation, again keeping costs low for the actors as some will need to stay a bit more frequently in the perfomance week. I'm hoping to be in talks with local B&B or hotels that are supporting the local hospital charity./The set design will be minimalist, with attention on different levels and lighting with a surrealistic looking hospital atmosphere. This will take a bit of time a money to create, but confident that our set designer will produce something exciting./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"tissue-by-louise-page-a-play-about-breast-cancer","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"2460.47267284","backers_count":69,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":938256,"background_color":null,"project_id":938256,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1425915851,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/670/432/436b7b7ca7f67964add13151db7734f6_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=090005&v=1463686569&auto=format&q=92&s=05ee29f28aa645ba20913925b3f179e8","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/670/432/436b7b7ca7f67964add13151db7734f6_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=090005&v=1463686569&auto=format&q=92&s=05ee29f28aa645ba20913925b3f179e8"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"\"Tissue\" is a play about Breast Cancer.

Battle. We currently present our stage plays at venues throughout the Baltimore/Metropolitan area.The goals of these dynamic stage play productions are to Uplift, Inspire, Educate, and Encourage. Attendees of all ages, nationalities, and walks of life, enjoy the timely material, hilarious slice-of-life comedy, riveting drama, life-changing spiritual messages, and inspirational singing. ///////////////In the wake of unemployment, drug addiction, peer pressure, and other societal ills, our productions also provide REAL SOLUTIONS. Our productions also highlight the importance of breast cancer awareness, and other health-related topics. Playwright Battle writes these original productions. /////Recently, she teamed up with Director extraordinaire (impresario) Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch, Executive Director and Founder of Unified Voices (UV) of Johns Hopkins. As a Battle Stage Plays Volunteer, Dr. Branch shares his talents and time to make our productions spectacular.  ///Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch, Director & Playwright Ursula V. Battle.///Our Team also includes dozens of performers and production members. We have been blessed to bring supporters our phenomenal stage play productions thanks to Dr. Branch and the rest of our Team's countless volunteer hours./////////////////////A few months ago, Baltimore City was cast in a negative light following the riots that took place after the death of Freddie Gray. But our productions illustrate that our young people are talented and doing positive things. ///////////////Our stage plays also showcase the talent of our seniors, and also provides them with an affordable, engaging form of entertainment.///Musician Jimmy Riley from our stage play production \"DisChord in The Choir.\"/////////////The “good word of mouth” has spread about our stage plays. The outcome has been rave reviews, sold-out performances, media coverage, and a growing demand to bring our plays and their entertaining messages of hope in these trying times to other areas. //////////////////////All we need is a “Kickstart” to get this “Show On The Road.” That’s where YOU come in. We are seeking to raise funds to cover developmental costs and move closer towards touring our dynamic hit stage plays.. We are setting an initial funding goal of $5,000 to address our immediate needs.//////Our immediate needs include hiring a Promoter, purchasing costumes, set materials, conducting workshops and other activities. THE BEAUTY OF KICKERSTARTER & YOU is that we can raise funds beyond our $5,000 funding goal and begin aiming to reach \"Stretch Goals\". If we exceed our initial campaign goal, we can STRETCH to reach another monetary goal - $7,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, $100,000...who knows?  The more we raise, the more we can do, and the closer we move towards making our tour dreams a reality. /////We could have the potential to raise enough money to enable us to approach and book major theatrical playhouses around the country, secure space rental for rehearsals, obtain music licenses, purchase props, cover travel expenses, and hire technical professionals. We could also purchase equipment such as musical instruments, microphones, and a storage facility to house it all.In August, 2014, we were blessed to work with renowned singer and actress D'Atra Hicks. ///D’Atra Hicks performing in \"The Teachers' Lounge.\".//////Ms. Hicks and other Cast Members during a performance of “The Teachers’ Lounge.”///Hicks' singing ability and rousing performance was dynamic. Building off that success, we would like to raise enough funds to retain at least one headliner performer for each of our stage play presentations.  //////We just need for you to give. It could be as little as $1 or as high as $10,000. Our current success has given us the necessary momentum to make this campaign “A HIT.” With that in mind, this campaign could also blossom into a major entrepreneurship venture, complete with a variety of job and internship opportunities for aspiring performers and production personnel. Which of our hit stage plays will be first to tour? Help us decide./////Will it be Ursula V. Battle's DisChord in The Choir? This gospel stage play musical comedy is about the dramatic chain of events, which follows the sudden death of The United in Victory Tabernacle on the Hill Freewill Baptist Catholic and Episcopal Church of God’s longtime musician and the ensuing scandal that rocks the church. This production played before sell-out audiences March 2015. /////Or, will it be Ursula V. Battle’s The Teachers’ Lounge? This production centers around the lives of six teachers who find refuge in The Teachers’ Lounge, where they gather during their /long-awaited lunch break to feast on juicy gossip, riveting secrets, insatiable desires, and even secret romance. This play has been presented on several occasions, and calls attention to the challenges educators face on a daily basis. ///PERFORMANCES: Sat. 12/19/15 (2 p.m. & 7 p.m.) and Sun. 12/20/15 (5 p.m.) at John Hopkins' Turner Auditorium, 720 N. Rutland Ave., Balt., MD 21205.///Or, will it be our soon-to-be-a-hit stage play Ursula V. Battle's My Big Phat Ghetto FABULE$$ Wedding?  Set to debut in Baltimore, Maryland at Johns Hopkins' Turner Auditorium December 19-20, 2015, this hilarious production is about what happens when a reversal of fortune causes a couple’s expensive Wedding plans to turn into a beer bucket budget nightmare, setting the stage for the most unforgettable Wedding you have ever attended. More on each of these stage plays and other productions can be found on www.battlestageplays.com/Maybe one day they all can tour.

ECAS has been bringing Latino-themed and Spanish-language performing arts to Rhode Island since 1997. The performances in Cuba, scheduled for July 2, 3 and 4, will complete a circuit that began in 2013, when a playwright living in Cuba, Jesus Del Castillo, entered a new play, Deporte Nacional, into a writing contest sponsored by the Providence Community Libraries (PCL) and several Rhode Island-based Latino arts organizations. ECAS staged the play in Providence last year and Del Castillo traveled to Providence to watch its premiere. Now ECAS has been invited to present it in Cuba. Deporte Nacional is a semi-biographical play about a man, Orestes, who has turned his back on baseball, Cuba’s national sport, in an effort to erase painful memories involving his mother’s murder and his father’s exile in the US. An unexpected visitor challenges his view of the game and the world, changing Orestes’ life forever. The play explores the Cuban exile experience from the perspective of those left behind, and also touches on issues of acceptance and diversity related to sexual identity in contemporary Cuban society./This will be the play's premiere in Cuba and the ECAS cast is also going to participate in community workshops in Havana and Matanzas. Upon their return, the cast will host a community forum to talk about their experiences in Cuba and begin a conversation about building cultural bridges between both countries. The Cuban Ministry of Culture has extended an invitation to the theater group to present the play in a theater festival that takes place in July. That invitation, however, does not include coverage of travel or accommodations for ECAS Theater. That's up to us (with your generous support)./The play has a cast of five actors. ECAS needs to raise $7,000 to cover travel expenses. We are already on our way to that goal. You can help make this possible. Background on the play: http://oncubamagazine.com/culture/deporte-nacional-will-premiere-in-the-united-states/","risks and challenges":"The risks and obstacles involved in completing this project involve funding, as it is very expensive to get to Cuba. We are a grassroots, all-volunteer arts organization with very limited resources. We are raising funds through performances, personal donations, and now through Kickstarter.

The show will be performed 12 times at the at Madison Street Theatre in Oak Park, Illinois (just outside Chicago). Why Kickstarter?We are aiming to provide the reward options to you as a way to say, \"Thank You\" for your support and interest in our theatre collective.  Kickstarter allows us to raise \"seed money\" for we are just starting out and need to gain financial backing as our 501(c)(3) processes. A donation in order to raise a small amount of money would be very helpful at this time. We will send you a \"thank you\" letter with our E.I.N on it for tax purposes along with your reward(s).We feel that we can reach a wide variety of people through Kickstarter!Kickstarter, ultimately, aims to give each one of us a chance to fund our ideas, starting directly with the people who are closest to it (friends, fans, community-fellows). And it’s a way to break beyond the traditional methods — loans, investment, industry deals, grants — to discover that we can offer each other value through creation without a middleman dictating the product and terms.How much money is needed from me?We are seeking the amount of $3,871.00 to get us off the ground. Currently, our 501(c)(3) status is under review, pending and processing! What are you all about? I want to know a little more! I am very curious!!/The Saltbox Theatre Collective's mission is to share stories that realize the human experience. We hope to one day have our own space in Chicago and produce productions that involve educators, novice performers and designers, and other artists who would not normally be involved in the theatrical process. What else do you foresee going on with Saltbox in future?We also hope to one day produce shows with students and adults whom have special needs and disabilities for we feel there is a great need for this in the Chicago land area. Also, we hope to one day provide mini-theatre festivals partnering with other small, not-for-profit theatre companies in order to create partnerships. Any and all additional \"seed money\" will go towards future productions, rental space and artist funding. Who are you? I would love to see the people involved in this project!I encourage you to watch the four minute video above and browse our website at www.saltboxtheatre.org to get a sense of what we are about.Though we are discovering our voice and \"Identity\" this season, there are many people who have not been paid and have volunteered so much of their time already in support of our efforts. These wonderful people are (in no specific order): /Jeramie Simmons /David and Jill Burke /Katie Zisson /Amy Moore /Lauren Demerath /Andrea and Molly Gustafson /David Rice /Don Kovach /Andy Pederson /Chris Onken /Steven Cox /Ben Schneider /Morgan Brown /Mario Treto, Jr. /Mark and Terri Bernstien /Danielle Swanson /Chas Howard /Lisa Weber /Rosemary Foley/April Hunsucker/Jared Williams /Stephen Hancock /Alice Berry /John Yorke /Marie & Ira Goodkin /Corwyn Cullum /Daniel and Michael Appearson/What is your closing statement?If you support live theatre, the arts, me (Brian) or any of the above mentioned people, we ask you to kindly consider making a small or large donation in their honor.

Creations Presents 'Phantom Pain' - Ed Fringe 2014","info":{"description":"We are Unhinged Creations, a fledgling theatre company founded at the University of Warwick. This year we're taking our first play, Phantom Pain, to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Phantom Pain is a new play written by John Servante - the play promotes mental health awareness and is produced, directed and performed by members of the company.  During his time at university, John suffered with mental health issues – chronic depression and severe anxiety. As a result of the stigma that surrounds this John set out, through Unhinged Creations, to create artistic responses to mental illness. We hope these will be socially responsible pieces which help to raise awareness about mental health issues and in the long term the company hopes to afford creative opportunities to individuals suffering with mental illness. Phantom Pain follows the lives of a group of people as they come to terms with the suicide of one of their friends, James, and explores the various responses people have to suicide, seeking to dispel some of the notions people hold about mental illness. Having already had a successful run at the University of Warwick (leading to the National Student Drama Festival to positively review it as a “strange, touching, poignant piece of theatre”), it is to be performed at Theatre 2, The Space@Northbridge, between 11th and 16th August. After each performance, collections will be held in the lobby for the mental health charity Mind, as the play is in aid of the charity. /Unfortunately, as the play seeks to raise awareness about mental health issues, which include suicide, certain avenues are closed to us for fundraising (especially funding through any religious groups). //The controversial nature of the text also makes public sponsorship problematic, as people are uncomfortable with supporting artistic responses to suicide and suicidal thoughts. This is somewhat distressing: one in four people each year will suffer with a mental health issue and the leading cause of death in males of our age group is suicide. In short, this taboo subject desperately needs to be talked about! ","risks and challenges":"Financial concern for the production as well as the cast and crew is our major challenge. However, we obviously also face the challenges of securing an audience once we're up in Edinburgh as well as managing to raise money for Mind./We plan to aggressively market our show in Edinburgh. We hope the piece will speak for itself and leave audiences with much to discuss as they leave the theatre, but getting people to come and see a show which tackles our subject matter is very difficult. Our plan is to showcase select scenes which would be appropriate and respectful. We also hope, through social media and flyering, to give insight in to what it's like to work on a project about mental illness and to spread our enthusiasm for the issues the play seeks to discuss./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"unhinged-creations-presents-phantom-pain-ed-fringe","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"8607.02151408","backers_count":63,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":1074746,"background_color":null,"project_id":1074746,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1425915859,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=d799bf2256af25db8baa5c761db9079c","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=d799bf2256af25db8baa5c761db9079c"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Phantom Pain - a new play promoting mental health awareness written and performed by fledgling theatre company Unhinged Creations.","launched_at":1404749446,"location":{"displayable_name":"Edinburgh, UK","slug":"edinburgh-gb","type":"Town","urls":{"api":{"nearby_projects":"https://api.kickstarter.com/v1/discover?signature=1484567327.33658ade7bb3bf91ae56fa73475b576397b31a4d&woe_id=19344"},"web":{"location":"https://www.kickstarter.com/locations/edinburgh-gb","discover":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/places/edinburgh-gb"}},"state":"Scotland","is_root":false,"id":19344,"country":"GB","short_name":"Edinburgh, UK","name":"Edinburgh"},"static_usd_rate":1.71591338,"state":"successful","pledged":5016,"staff_pick":false,"goal":5000,"category":{"slug":"theater/plays","position":6,"urls":{"web":{"discover":"http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays"}},"parent_id":17,"id":285,"color":16743775,"name":"Plays"},"state_changed_at":1407106811,"id":698303421,"currency_trailing_code":false,"deadline":1407106800,"currency":"GBP","photo":{"small":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=160&h=90&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=44c7edef671a4b48f3799f8e588dc55c","key":"assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg","1536x864":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=d799bf2256af25db8baa5c761db9079c","1024x576":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=1024&h=576&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=b662200d396a550ed548a2db6d1d0ef7","ed":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=338&h=190&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=d5a0e485070f930a387745f8ccb2921f","thumb":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=40&h=22&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=d38aef0d4add28cbb4983b4ade24afa0","full":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=560&h=315&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=a04b0c23859ec9557750b9628f182644","little":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=200&h=112&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=716a78b1affb07e5872b1597eebeb493","med":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/728/347/b5ea9899e11794f4ccbd01ae81c9e8f6_original.jpg?w=266&h=150&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463687415&auto=format&q=92&s=74d85e79650bff66c47166adb369ff69"},"creator":{"name":"J.

We’re Suitcase Civilians, and we’re presenting Wilde Tales, a theatrical adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s short stories. The show will play at The Space in London from April 5-10, 2016. It’s written and directed by Sepy Baghaei, and performed by Jade Allen, Harriett Attwood, Heath Ivey-Law, and Ashley Pekri.WHAT DO WE NEED?As this is an independent production, we need a little bit of help covering our costs! Below is a breakdown of what we need, and an estimate of how much it will cost:/Rehearsal Space Hire (£100) /Props/Consumables (£100) /Costume (£50) /Equipment hire (£60) /Postcard printing and social media advertising (£50)/TOTAL = £360We’re setting our goal at £250 – if we make it beyond that, great! If not, the initial target would be fantastic too.Thanks so much for your help, and we look forward to seeing you at the show!","risks and challenges":"With any independent production, the biggest challenge is getting the word out there, and getting bums on seats! Being able to afford marketing materials such as postcards and social media advertising is a big help in doing this./Furthermore, making your own work means you can sometimes be limited in making the best possible show, simply due to finances. While we aren’t looking to build a huge elaborate set or have actors flying from the ceiling, we would like to be able to afford basic costume, props and lighting elements to create a show where big

Ding - A Globetrotting Comedy","info":{"description":"Das Ding will be performed at the New Diorama Theatre in London, UK from 14 October - 1 November 2014 in a production directed by Tanja Pagnuco.  http://newdiorama.com/whats-on/das-dingThe PlayThe play follows the journey of a cotton boll that travels around the world: from the fields in Africa to being made into a t-shirt in China to being sold in Europe and being then recycled and shipped back to Africa. Throughout this journey, we encounter different characters such as a married couple in Germany, a touring photographer, two Chinese entrepreneurs, a Swiss development aid worker and an African farmer. They are all delicately linked by threads so slight they are initially invisible, but as the play unfolds, we start seeing a globe-spanning network of interdependencies. The thing (the cotton ball) looks on amazed at the wheelings and dealings of humanity. Das Ding offers a moving and humorous observation on our globalised world. BudgetWe are very grateful to have received a Small Grants Fund from the Arts Council of England, the support from the Swiss Cultural Fund towards our Swiss set and costume designer and the support of the Unity Theatre Trust. This has meant that we've been able to secure the rights for the play, our venue, the salaries for our cast and creatives and fund part of our ambitious set design. A theatre production at a professional level requires unfortunately more budget to pay other aspects of a production such as rehearsal space, marketing and the costumes of these 14 characters. By raising this money, it means we will not only get this project on its feet, but the project will be of the highest quality possible by having the space to form and for set/costume designer Martina Trottmann and director Tanja Pagnuco to fully realise their vision for Das Ding./This ProductionDas Ding is a black comedy about our globalised world. It has a lot of humour in the depiction of its characters and the situations they find themselves involved in but underneath all that lies a lot of tension, fear and insecurities about the future of our globalised world, which this production is aiming to explore.  /In rehearsals, we are joining a text-based approach to a more European theatre approach that incorporates devising into play-text, improvisation and techniques to trigger the actors’ playfulness, deconstructing the narrative to create images and moods. Although the play talks about us today and is incredibly true to the mechanisms of our world, the style of the play demands non-naturalism, a heightened form of acting and a strong sense of playfulness./The Cast This piece will be performed by a cast of 5 who will play 14 characters. ///Martins Imhangbe, Ivy Corbin, Dylan Kennedy, Leo Wan and Christopher Lane/// The Creative teamDirector: Tanja Pagnuco/Set and Costume Designer: Martina Trottmann/Lighting Designer: Pablo Fernandez-Baz/Sound Designer: Max Pappenheim/Assistant Director: Katharina Reinthaller/The Playwright////Philipp Löhle - Playwright///Philipp Löhle is/an Award-winning German playwright. His plays have been performed on main/stages throughout Europe. In 2007, he won a commission from the Stückemarkt of/the Berliner Theatertreffen. His play Call Me Gospodin was nominated for the Mülheimer/Dramatikerpreis in 2008. In 2012, he was nominated for the Mülheimer/Dramatikerpreis and won the audience award for Das Ding. /The Co-Producers: StoneCrabs Theatre CompanyStoneCrabs is a professional theatre company based in Lewisham, South London with an artistic policy to deliver British and international Theatre and Educational and arts projects at the highest professional standards. Drawing upon the creativity of artists and writers of many cultures, StoneCrabs seeks to create a deeper understanding of the richness and diversity of the society in which we live.///StoneCrabs Theatre Company - Co-Producers","risks and challenges":"This production is full of challenges and that’s probably why it feels so exciting. /First of all, putting on any European new writing play on the London Fringe is never an easy task. You have to convince the funders, the venue and then the audiences that although they might not yet have heard about this playwright, nor this play, they need to trust you that it is an excellent play and that this playwright should be on our UK stages, and especially in a global city like London. /Then, there are the challenges within the play itself: 14 characters including one thing with a voice, more than 5 narratives all intertwined taking place in 9 different countries, scenes that jump back and forth in time, some scenes addressed to the audience, others behind a fourth wall... and all of this played out by just 5 actors!/Finally, another challenge has been more self-made: we have an ambitious vision for the piece in terms of the set design. Without revealing too much, our production will be full of things (‘das ding’ in German means ‘the thing’) and quite a few kilos of cotton!/Learn about accountability on

PRODUCE'd LA presents: Friends in Transient Places","info":{"description":"We THANK YOU for supporting new work. #kickstartfreshFRIENDS IN TRANSIENT PLACES by Jonathan Caren tells the story of a group of strangers flying from New York to Los Angeles. From baggage claim at JFK, to soaring through an electrical storm in the sky, and ending at LAX, the characters focus on their own troubles - hoarding, autism, estranged fathers, past lives, fallen religiosity, ex-boyfriends, new girlfriends, dead dogs... Whatever it is, it consumes them. As they travel from one side of the country to the other, we learn that their human connections are deeper than they'll ever realize. What makes this play special? To be honest, FRIENDS is awesome. Really. It's a unique play that combines musical theater elements, magical realism, a large cast of diverse characters, and still yanks at the heart strings. It reflects on the heart, life, and missed opportunities. This is a story for today - when we fear that hate will overtake love, while we question our neighbors' humanity, and when we yearn for entertainment with meaning.Who is FRESH PRODUCE'd? We are a group of theatre artists who serve emerging writers. We strive to bring new, alternative style theater to life. www.getfreshproduced.comWhat does FRESH PRODUCE'd do? Four times a year, we workshop new pieces. Twice a year we bring full-length productions to LA audiences. Our workshops are by donation only and we make no money from them in order to ensure that everybody in the LA arts community has the opportunity to see new works while connecting with a community of artists.Our full-length productions are self-funded. As FRIENDS IN TRANSIENT PLACES is such a large-scale production, we need to supplement our regular budget.What the money will go to:$1350 - Theater rental.$4200 - Designers, director, stage manager, musicians, playwright, and actor fees. We believe that it is of the utmost importance to pay professional artists respectable rates in order to grow the theater community.$1050 - Set, props and costumes.$600 - Designing and printing programs, postcards, posters. Printing scripts. Online notices.$300 - Insurance.$500 - Rehearsal space.Total fundraising needs: $8,000","risks and challenges":"This campaign will allow us the opportunity to continue the work we do and to expand and diversify. But theater is risky - and we know this because it isn't our first production. So when problems arise, we will problem solve our way out of them, just as we've done in the past for our previous 3 successful productions. The show must go on! /And guess what? This should be the last time we'll have to fundraise in this manner - because we are applying to be a 501c3! We're not there yet, so right now we need your help./Learn about accountability on

I Live","info":{"description":"ABOUT THIS PROJECT'Today I Live' is a new play by British/American playwright Susan-Jane Harrison. This production is brought to you as part of the RADA Festival (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) in London. It plays at the GBS Theatre RADA between 23 June and 2 July 2016./Can desire transcend time?/ /A man and a woman living centuries apart in the same flat gradually become aware of one another. This mysterious sexual charge permeates their work and their sleep, driving them to distraction and inspiration./ /In 2017, Niaz, a British-Iranian artist seeks refuge to unravel which elements of her current crisis are existential and which are marital. In 1821, Michael, an Irish mapmaker, is scarred by the Napoleonic wars, his new solitary life a temporary shield from the shadows of his Dublin past./ /As the walls between Michael and Niaz crumble, ghosts long-forgotten find their way home. / /\"Today I Live\" explores the trauma of immigration, drawing on Ferdowsi's epic poem \"Shahnameh\" and legends of the Irish hero Cúchulainn. /What makes it stand out?/ /‘Today I Live’, written by RADA graduate by Susan-Jane Harrison is a rich and subtle story, extensively work-shopped and meticulously researched. We have assembled an outstanding company:/ /Directed by Delyth Jones (Artistic Director Io Theatre Company)/Designed by Amanda Mascarenhas/Cast: Richard Cotton, Viss Elliot Safavi, Loz Keystone, Rob Marni and Soudabeh Neeya /‘Today I Live’ is a ghost story. Effectively, we see two stories play out simultaneously in the same flat, stories that weave between one another. Through the course of the play, characters gradually become aware of the presence of others through shared objects, sounds and smells. Desire for persons unknown and unseen begins to grow. The link between Persian and Irish legends, in which the play is steeped, becomes a visceral connection between characters separated by almost 200 years. It is also a play about immigration, what it means to be disconnected from one’s place of origin and how that sense of disconnection permeates all aspects of life - an issue so pressing in our world today.What's the plan?//The venue for this current production is the GBS Theatre RADA in central London and the play is bought to you as part of the RADA Festival 2016. The producers are Local Dystopia (USA) and Fab Shack Productions (UK). Our determination is for this production to spark further interest and generate a future life for the play./Where does the money go?/ /We have just over £5,000 cash and over £20,000 worth of in-kind support (venue, technical provision, graphic designer, printing). So we just have enough money to stage the play and the production is going ahead. The cash that we have is going towards to the wages of the actors and creative team, but we are asking for your help to raise a further £3350 to lift wages to the equivalent of the minimum set out by the actors’ union Equity and take the set design and construction to the level that the production requires./THE TEAM/Susan-Jane Harrison – Playwright/Susan-Jane Harrison is a British-American playwright and performer.

By telling stories we help people think differently about issues and give them an emotional connection which inspires them to action.

By partnering with local organizations we give people immediate contact with those doing work on the ground that they can get involved with while their emotions are still engaged.Our first show is one that was voted on by our Facebook community! It's called \"Cup of Salvation\". A young priest takes a job bartending to make ends meet. This creates conflict both with his Bishop and church, but also in his own conscience as he realizes that the conversations he's having at the bar are more meaningful than many of the conversations he's having in his ministry. We're working on partnering with local new church starts that are doing things in innovative ways, as well as new local breweries who are giving back to the communities.  The money we raise will go toward renting theatre space (about $4000), sets, marketing, and paying some of the people involved, as well as printing and shipping all of the perks. $6000 is the bare minimum to make this show happen. Anything we raise over the $6000 will allow us to pay more of the people involved and do more in-depth marketing. ","risks and challenges":"Obviously any theatre project could face delays; availability of space, actors, etc. But we don't forsee any major issues./I've written and produced two full length plays before and have connections to a lot of local non-profits.

We discover that nothing and no-one is every really gone as long as you have your memories..///There Once Was a Princess Called Felicity///This project began with an experimental performance at Bishop Grosseteste University, After great success, we decided to create a small organisation which we names: Cardboard Castles. In order to give us a way to perform children's theatre to the local community. After getting the basics done and out of the way decided our first task would be to extend this project and give it a real purpose. ///Paper Dolls Ft The Friendly but Grumpy Crocodile///The performance and the workshop which we wish to do, is aimed at 6-11 year old's and focuses on bereavement and terminal illness, the different ways people deal with these things, and the ways we should approach the issues with young people. It deals with the difficult topic in a child friendly manner, but not in a way which patronises young people. We believe that this is a topic which is very important to educate both adults and young people on. It takes a very long time for anyone to process the illness or the loss of a family member, and it can take even longer if handled wrong. We are hoping to take this performance and an accompanying workshop into local primary schools in and around Lincoln around May/June time of 2016 and then up to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this August.Something a little bit quirky about our project is that everything we do takes place in a large tent, which the audience are seated in with the performance happening in the middle and around the tent. Comments we have received about this suggest that the use of the tent creates a small escape for a short period of time for our audience, it allows adults to get back in touch with their younger side and really experience the events of the piece with the two sisters, from a child's perspective.///Where the Magic Happens///There are currently ten people involved in this project, including the original cast/crew (Ella Manning, Kara Bailey, Maria Sands and Zachary Anthony-Ciarla, Daniel Swift, and myself- Shannon Toyne) and some new people who have come on board after seeing our initial performances (Joe Brammer, Hannah Smith, India Swordy, Emily Spalding) Every person involved is extremely dedicated to getting it on it's feet and making this happen. ///Cast Photo at Our Initial Performance- 2015///The Money Bit Unfortunately project's like these don't happen for nothing! Although currently we are not taking a wage from this project, as we want to use it as a start up so we can offer more projects like these to the community. The cost of this project is currently estimated around £5,500 this includes, all of our costs up until we are in Edinburgh, this money would allow us to bring our performance into many schools in and around Lincoln, and have an impact on many groups of young people. Before giving us an additional opportunity to take it up to Edinburgh and make some new contacts and friends in the arts industry, which will hopefully give us all the tools we need to start building ourselves up as an organisation! The reason we have put our target at around £700 is because whilst this is happening, we are also working hard ourselves to raise additional funds all of which we will keep you up to date on! So far we have baked hundreds of cakes, and ran a fairly crazy theatre themed pub quiz, all of these are small events, which add up in time, and we won't stop running these until we have the funds we need.However these events can only take us so far, so we are turning to you guys in hopes you will see the importance of our project, and the dedication we are putting in to get it off the ground! No donation is too small, and we gratefully appreciate any help we receive over this period. Thank-you for reading our story, and don't hesitate to ask us any questions in our question box! ///I Love Your Hat, Can We Swap?","risks and challenges":"Well for a start, the putting up of the tent is an interesting and challenging process! /But on a serious note, this is just the tip of the iceberg for the financial side of this project, as I stated above, this project needs around £5500 to run, however regardless of how this goes, we will still be going ahead with the project, it does however mean we might have to make some sacrifices, which we believe alter the impact our performance has, the tent would probably be one of the first things we have to cut back on, which is sad as it is the thing which draws people in, and what really involves the entire audience with our performance. /We will however, be doing everything in our power regardless of the success of this kickstarter, to do this project justice and make it happen! /So thanks in advance for any support you have to offer us!/Learn about accountability on

Girl: A Cup Full of Courage","info":{"description":"Ultramarine Girl: A Cup Full of Courage is a new, original play that focuses/on spina bifida awareness. Local playwright Aspen Mock and community activist/Rachel Allen are collaborating on a project that will serve as a fundraiser and/promote spina bifida awareness. After copious research and working with/consultant Riley Allen (who is an expert in living with spina bifida), Aspen/Mock has written an original, fictional play entitled Ultramarine Girl: A Cup/Full of Courage, which will have its world premiere July 2015 at Greater/Johnstown Career and Technology Center in Johnstown, Pennsylvania./About the Show:/This one act play is a contemporary fantasy that takes place in a quaint/cottage nestled in a picturesque beach on the Maryland shoreline. Orva, the/main character, is a courageous and triumphant teenage girl who lives with her/mother, Enide. Enide is encouraging Orva to attend a spina bifida camp to make/friends and develop a transitional plan. Orva, an imaginative girl, loves her/home with her mother and doesn’t even want to think about a transitional plan/at this stage in her life. All seems well on the surface, but what lies beneath/the water are the nefarious machinations of the villainous Vodnik. Vodnik, a/deleterious sea soul, is obsessed with becoming a powerful sea god. To complete/his transition into a god he needs to acquire something special he has never/known: courage. He thus maniacally seeks to steal one thing and one thing/alone: Orva’s courage. Vodnik enslaves Merrow, an entrancing mermaid who has/befriended Orva, and tries to exploit their friendship for his own malevolent/benefit. Will Orva's courage be stolen from her? Find out in July 2015! Besides/telling a compelling, enchanting story, the play’s message is that persons with/disabilities, specifically Spina Bifida, are empowered and autonomous/individuals who have goals, dreams and aspirations. Above all, people living/with Spina bifida have the courage to face daily challenges head-on with/positivity, strength and grace./The play set is being conceptualized, designed and built by Terry Mock, who/has been constructing various sets for the past eight years. Not only will the/set be artistically beautiful, but will function to accommodate characters with/disabilities. The set materials are being funded by a grant received from the/Pennsylvania Rural Arts Alliance. James Walter Elston has created an original/artistic logo for the production. Former college and professional football/coach Ed Jenkins is assisting with graphic design and marketing. Original music/is being written for the play; the production will feature local thespians./The play will be performed on the Greater Johnstown Vocational and Technical/Center stage next summer 2015 on Friday, July 31st at 7:00 PM, Saturday August/1 at 7:00 PM and Sunday August 2nd at 2:00 PM. For more information, ticket/sales, and ways you can help donate toward the cause please visit our website/at www.ultramarinegirl.com.

Youth Theatre (SYT) - The Tempest","info":{"description":"Shakespearean Youth Theatre is thrilled to be producing The/Tempest as their eleventh production. Every year SYT holds a fundraiser to/raise funds for our production. This year, we decided to put together a/Kickstarter./My name is Victoria, and I am in my fifth year of SYT. I’m/seventeen years old, and I’m playing Prospero in SYT’s The Tempest! /What is the project?/SYT is a theater company for youth between the ages of 13-18 to/put on Shakespeare shows and learn about theater. Every year we get to work/with a professional director who teaches an acting workshop in the Fall and/then directs a Spring production! We get to play famous Shakespeare roles like/King Lear from King Lear, Puck from A Midsummer Night’s Dream,/and Benedict and Beatrice from Much Ado About Nothing.Along the way, we develop a/solid understanding of Shakespeare, grow exponentially as actors, work with/established theatre artists, and create awesome productions we’re proud of./It’s an amazing experience! /The Tempest: /In this year’s play, The Tempest, Prospero (the character/I’m playing!) dwells on an enchanted isle with her daughter Miranda. She is a/sorcerer and the rightful Duke of Milan. Twelve years earlier, the duke's/sister, Antonio, and Alonso, the King of Naples, conspired to usurp her throne./They set Prospero and Miranda adrift in a boat, and they eventually found/themselves marooned on the island. Prospero is served on her island by Ariel, a/spirit who she freed from a tree with magic, and Caliban, son of the witch/Sycorax. When magic reveals that a ship bearing her old enemies is sailing near/the island, Prospero summons a storm to wreck their ship. The survivors make it/to shore in scattered groups. [taken from http://www.bardweb.net/plays/tempest.html] /Our take on it: /We’re setting our play in the early 1900’s,/in an alternate universe where steam-powered technology rules the world. While/there are very real spirits, Prospero harnesses the power of the spirit world/through genius machinery, rather than actual sorcery. However, because there/still is magic in the play, we’re playing a lot with fabric to create effects,/using shadow screens, and what are essentially basic magic tricks. We’re using big/pieces of fabric to create the world, and PVC pipes to create Prospero’s/machinery./We started rehearsals on the 8th of January, and by the/time this Kickstarter is live, we’ll be a little more than a week from opening/on the 25th of February.

We called him The Hero. That’s what the whole town called him.”Sea Life is a dark comedy set on the crumbling shores of England, where keeping a tight grip on past and present is as hard as holding back the rising tide. It is written by Pearson Television Writer’s Award winner Lucy Catherine, former writer-in-residence at Bristol Old Vic, and now best known for her work on BBC TV (The Musketeers, Being Human, Frankie), and her Radio 4 plays and adaptations.Sea Life will be the follow-up to The Hope Theatre’s multi award-winning first in-house production Lovesong of the Electric Bear which transferred to the West End in 2015. It is directed by Matthew Parker, Off West End Award nominated Artistic Director of The Hope Theatre.STRETCH GOAL: £2,500.00With a week to go, we've hit our target and we're so grateful to everyone who has been able to donate! As we continue to share the campaign we thought we'd let you know what further donations will go towards: If we can reach £500 on top of our goal we can increase our set and costume budgets, helping our designers Laura and Rachael realise their ambitious plans for the show - including vintage dresses, bespoke coffins and truckloads of real sandwiches. We'll also be able to add one or two additional rehearsal sessions with our full cast during previews - allowing us to fine-tune the show ahead of Press Night!THE PLAYIf your grandad tried to swim the English Channel with a plate of sandwiches strapped to his head, you might think your family was a little bizarre. But what if you didn’t know any different?/////As their sleepy seaside town slips slowly into the sea, Bob, Bob and Eddie are trying to save their neighbours from ending up at the bottom of the ocean. The only thing is, their neighbours are already six feet under.\"A stunning piece … the humour comes in one colour: funereal black\" - The Independent\"A quite extraordinary piece of theatre\" - The Stage WHAT DO WE NEED AND WHY? We are asking for your help to raise £2,000 to help fund this London premiere production of this fantastic play, which will run from 24th May to 11th June 2016. The Hope Theatre was the first Off West End venue to open with a house agreement with Equity, to ensure a legal wage for all actors, stage managers and box office staff working at the theatre.However, the theatre receives no public subsidy. So to pay our actors and stage management properly, as well as creating fantastic sets and costume, we need to reach out to you.OUR SUPPORTERSWe want to ensure our supporters have the best experience of SEA LIFE, so all backers will be thanked on Twitter and receive regular updates from us on the show. You’ll be the first to know about our casting, see rehearsal photos and more. For those that give a little more we would love to thank you by name in our programme, give you a poster, arrange tickets for performances, drinks at press night, signed copies of Lucy Catherine’s fantastic script, invitations to our Q&A with Lucy and Matthew Parker, and we’ll even organise corporate packages.PRAISE FOR MATTHEW PARKER’S WORK: ★★★★★ “An exciting, magical, odd and touching show that isn’t easy to forget.

Help us produce the globally renowned production of Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues!About this project: It’s bold. It’s sassy. It’s fierce. It’s emotional. Hilarious. Sentimental. Thought-provoking. Intelligent. But The Vagina Monologues is more than just a play. It is a conversation, it is a movement, it is a safe haven and it is a revolution to end violence towards women and girls; including rape, battery, incest, female genital mutilation and sex slavery. As part of the V-Day Campaign, this global activism movement is working towards increasing awareness and building a network of strong, educated and empowered women and girls around the world to promote a violence-free living environment through education and recognition. In conjunction with its 15th Anniversary, the V-Day Campaign has launched its most ambitious campaign to date, the largest mass action in human history - ONE BILLION RISING.  /////The concept of the campaign is simple. If we take into account the statistics that 1 in 3 women will experience violence in her lifetime, we are left with the staggering number that over 1 billion women on this planet will be impacted by violence.Over the years, the V-Day Campaign has not only grown substantially, but has reached out to 200 hundred countries where women, men and youth come together to RISE, DANCE, and DEMAND the end to violence against women and girls. /At the University of Utah, it gives us every reason to want to be a part of such successful campaign. Through the production of The Vagina Monologues, we can make a difference in our community. We can be a substantial resource for those in need, and be the change we want to see and feel in our communities. /Please rise with us by supporting us! /Only with your donation we can put on a production of The Vagina Monologues. While the director and the entire cast of the V-Team are all hardworking and dedicated volunteers, our goal is to raise money to pay rental fees for the theatre space, technicians, lighting, sound and three performances.  This is where you come in!  We are asking for your donation of any amount to help cover these necessary  expenses and to ensure we make the most of our V-Day University of Utah Campaign. ////// The Vagina Monologues is scheduled to be on stage on February 20, 21 and 22, 2015 at 7:00 pm, at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts Dumke Auditorium on the campus of the University of Utah. /For more information on the V-Day Movement or the One Billion Rising Campaign, visit:/http://www.onebillionrising.org/http://www.vday.org//THANK YOU for your support and we hope to see you at the performance!/FAQ//Have a question? Please ask the project creator directly.  nap_hegedus@hotmail.com/Join us on Facebook and help us spread the word! https://www.facebook.com/events/1600779480151455/","risks and challenges":"A challenge we are accepting as an entire team and as individuals who are passionate about spreading the word of the 1 Billion Rising Campaign in our community, is just how much we can do. /As women's activists and now official Vagina Warriors, we have become a resource; an essential part to a specific community in our city./The challenge will be seeing and feeling the difference in our communities.

Tag starrt die junge, arbeitslose Kim stundenlang auf den flimmernden Bildschirm. Um sie herum verwandelt sich ihr trister Alltag in eine kunterbunte Unterhaltungswelt, die sich zwischen seichten Kochsendungen, Dating- und Talkshows windet. Dieser imaginäre Zufluchtshafen bietet jedoch nur für kurze Zeit Sicherheit und Geborgenheit: das eigene Wohnzimmer wird zu einem Tatort, indem sich Träume unmerklich in Albträume verwandeln, und der Wahn im Kopf die Grenzen des Bewusstseins überschreitet. Nora Wageners erstes Theaterstück Visions lädt den Zuschauer auf eine teils lustige, teils düstere Reise in die eigenen vier Wände ein, in einen Ort, den man eigentlich mit Alltäglichkeit und Geborgenheit in Verbindung setzt. Doch was geschieht, wenn auf einmal Risse in der Normalität sichtbar werden? Die Premiere findet in der Escher Kulturfabrik statt,wo das „Ratelach“ zum Wohnzimmer ummodeliert wird. Die TNL-Aufführungen werden hingegen, um einen wohnlichen Charakter beizubehalten, ins „Bamhaus“ in Dummeldingen verlagert. Visions wird im Rahmen des 20jährigen Geburtstags des Theaterkollektivs ILL aufgeführt, neben Independent Little Luxembourg (September 2015) und Grexit (Januar, Februar 2016).Regie: Claire Thill   Text: Nora Wagener   Schauspiel: Leila Schaus, Sayoko Onishi, Felicity Grist Choreographie: Sayoko Onishi    Video: Melting Pol   Musik: Emre Sevindik         Regieassistenz: Gilles Seyler  Produktionsleitung: Jill ChristopheProduktion Independent Little Lies (www.ill.lu) in Koproduktion mit dem Centre Culturel Kulturfabrik d'Esch-sur-Alzette (www.kulturfabrik.lu) und dem Théâtre National du Luxembourg (www.tnl.lu). ","risks and challenges":"Independent Little Lies ist ein unabhängiges Theaterkollektiv ohne eigene Räumlichkeiten und ohne Konvention mit dem Kulturministerium.

2014 this production will be highly stylised, with an extreme physical edge and an exhilarating soundtrack performed live.DRACULA is the latest production from acclaimed theatre company ACTION TO THE WORD, an ensemble of artists presenting contemporary adaptations of classic works. Our recent adaptation of A Clockwork Orange (\"Imaginative and striking... it sizzles with energy\" Evening Standard ★★★★) enjoyed worldwide success after its season in Edinburgh 2012.This initial non-profit production is creatively driven by Alexandra Spencer-Jones (Artistic Director/Writer) and our creative team: Jo Chichonska (Musical Director/Orchestrations), Patrick Gleeson (Composer), Zoe Koperski (Design), Lyndsay Clark (Corset Design), Charlie Morgan-Jones (Lighting Design). WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?Every pound we raise here will go directly toward what you see on stage: the sets, costumes, props and musical instruments. The money will enable us to enhance our live band instead of using pre-recorded music. Even the costume making is costly - what can we say, 19th century steampunk corsets don't come cheap!Seriously, every single contribution (no matter the size) will make a huge difference to our show. We hugely appreciate your support.FEATURING AN ACTOR/MUSICIAN CAST///Rachel Bright and Jonno Davies (© Matt Martin 2014)///This electrifying reworking of the much loved gothic horror story will feature a powerhouse actor-musician cast of nine including:RACHEL BRIGHT (EastEnders) as Lucy Westenra and rising talent JONNO DAVIES (A Clockwork Orange) as Dracula./CAST LIST/THE COUNT – JONNO DAVIES JONATHAN HARKER – HENRY BAUCKHAM MINA MURRAY/ELIZABETH – OLIVIA BROMLEY LUCY WESTENRA – RACHEL BRIGHT VAN HELSING/HAWKINS - HENRY DOUTHWAITE ARTHUR HOLMWOOD - MARC RHYS RENFIELD – ADAM CLIFFORD QUINCY MORRIS – TOM WHITELOCK DR JOHANNA SEWARD – CLAIRE PETZALTHE YEAR IS 1897 & COMPUTERS CAME EARLYSet in 1897 - but in a world where computers and the electric guitar have already been invented - the narrative follows the original novel, packed with all the horror, the sexual tension and the dark violence it evokes.

Hiatus: Little Deaths 2016","info":{"description":"Brief Hiatus was born out of a desire to create more quality professional theatre in Brighton. A lot more.From classics, contemporary theatre, new writing, Shakespeare, local authors, foreign translations and our own devised work, we are an actor‐centred company aiming to create performances that stimulate the actors and audience equally, and to expose both to a wider range of theatrical experiences./Brief Hiatus also aims to create high quality work at low ticket prices so that everyone can have access to the theatre, whether they are fans of ours, students or just walk‐ups who come to see what's on. We are a Brighton-based theatre company formed in November 2015 with the aim of creating diverse, challenging works for local regional theatres. Our first production was Howard Barker’s Gertrude - The Cry in March/April 2016, which received an ‘Outstanding Show’ from FringeReview.com. Since then, we have planned a further three shows for our 2016 Little Deaths season, as well as our #VeryLittleDeaths season - the first of which launched alongside this crowdfund. We have also recently launched a video project - Shakespeare’s Wake, a collection of monologues, sonnets and other homages to Shakespeare’s work in honour of the 400th anniversary of his death, produced and performed by local actors, companies, directors and artists in and around Brighton and Hove. With five more productions planned for this year alone, the web series, and our 2017 season already in the works, we need your generous support to keep up our rapid momentum.//We aim to raise £5000 from by July 2nd 2016. We’ve already proved with our past productions, Gertrude and Othello, that we are capable of creating self-sustaining theatre. However, the upfront costs involved with staging a show can be a real setback, and it is increasingly hard for small, new companies in the arts to find the money to fund these costs. In order to stage two full scale productions as part of our Little Deaths season we are asking for £5000.Little Death costs// per production:Play licensing\t\t£90 x 6 performances\t\t£540/Rehearsal print\t\t\t\t\t£50/Marketing print\t\t\t\t\t\t£150/Online marketing\t\t\t\t\t£30/Rehearsal venue hire\t£10 x 50 hours\t\t\t£500/Theatre hire\t\t£150/day x 6 days\t\t£900/Props/set\t\t\t\t\t\t£80/Costumes\t\t\t\t\t\t£100//Total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t£2,350We passionately believe that theatre is an essential part of culture that can be used to create a dialogue with the audience, provide a safe access to catharsis, to talk to the future as well as making a historical record and to make magic.Thank you for your time, your trust and your support of the arts.","risks and challenges":"After we raise the money to fund our Little Deaths season the hard work really begins. In a world dominated by reality tv and talent shows it is increasingly hard to tempt audiences from their living rooms and in to the theatre.

original work written by Strangeloop company members.  We couldn't be more excited about these brand new scripts hitting the stage, but we need your help to realize these productions.  If you believe, as we do, that the theatre is for taking chances and bringing new stories to life, we hope you'll support our 8th season.“Krampus!,” an original horror parody by Mike Wozniak and Jaclyn Jensen, will fill the annual holiday show slot.  A fun and scary take on family Christmas and the Krampus myth (Google image search this if you have never heard of it.  You'll be glad you did!), it is sure to stand out among the saccharine offerings of the season. \"French with Me,\" Strangeloop's annual Valentine's Day collection of musings on love, will feature all new short pieces by company members.  \"Mitera'\" by Maria Burnham, will be the spring full production.  A show about three Greek sisters whose mother is still trying to run their lives, from beyond the grave, ''Mitera\" contains both fun and poignant moments only stories about family can accomplish.Your donation will help cover production costs like venue rental and marketing, as well as design elements such as costumes, sets, and lighting.  Strangeloop Theatre is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit.  All donations are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.Stayed tuned for updates on the shows, playwrights and Strangeloop.","risks and challenges":"When producing new works, there is always a financial risk.  New scripts by young playwrights, don't have the built-in familiarity to help draw crowds.  Fortunately, Strangeloop has experience putting up new plays. /As an itinerant Chicago company, Strangeloop can afford, in some ways, to take more risks than companies with more overhead.  This is one of the reasons we are pushing to do new works.  Many theatres simply can't afford the risk, and fewer new shows are being brought to life as a result.  Strangeloop raises all funds needed before producing any piece and is not dependent on ticket sales to pay for production./Strangeloop is small but resourceful.  We have been producing in Chicago for 7 years and have always risen to any production challenge. Our company members bring a range of experience in nearly every aspect of theatre, so we are able to adapt in light of setbacks./Here is a little history on past Strangeloop original productions./2009 \"The Millionaire Farmer\" adapted by Brad Gunter/\"...extremely enjoyable for its wit, great performances and good-natured fun.

Beans at Theatre503","info":{"description":"I was the most beautiful child, everyone always told me how much potential I had.From the director of Theatre503’s recently acclaimed BU21 comes Jelly Beans. Dan Pick’s first full-length play is a brutally honest, hilarious and pitch-black confessional about what happens when every axiom of your life turns out to be a lie.Dan Pick’s fresh and exciting writing reveals first-hand the story of a momentous day in the life of a young man teetering on the brink of self-destruction. As his drab existence isshattered by a violent attack and an escapist binge that sees him running from painful memories and present dangers, can a self-proclaimed hero save himself from oblivion?Jelly Beans considers what happens the moment a young man with a toxic combination of fear, loathing and delusions of grandeur is presented with a very real image of himself in the future, of what he’s doomed to become.Writer Dan Pick comments, 'We’re a generation raised on Disney, riddled with debt, anxiety and depression. We wished on stars as children but the happy endings we were promised seem more distant now than the farthest reaches of our universe. We live behind laptop screens, isolated by the very devices designed to connect us, fed to bursting on a diet rich in reality TV and pornography. It often feels as though we’re all facing our own individual crisis of purpose. And when you realise the happily-ever-after might not be yours?'This one-off limited run is from the creative team and production company behind BU21 (★★★★★- The Stage) and award-nominated Cans(★★★★ - Time Out).Stuart Slade comments, 'Dan is clearly one of the most gifted directors of his generation, and/when he sent me his first play, it became annoyingly apparent that he is, potentially, also/one of the most gifted writers as well. Jelly Beans has a searing confessional honesty to it, a/muscular brutality, but also a totally unexpected delicacy and tenderness. In the hands of the/astonishing Adam Harley it’s a play that sometimes difficult to watch, but always impossible/to ignore.'During our last production 'BU21' by Stuart Slade, after the literary team read Dan Pick's script, we were asked back immediately. With such short notice we need your help. We are pledging to raise £1,750 to pay our wonderful actor Adam Harley, and our incredible creative team, be able to rehearse properly and bring an excellent play to the stage. We revel at the chance to be back on the Theatre503 stage, but putting on productions takes months of fundraising and planning which we did not have. We hope this will help and we will see you on the Theatre503 stage!Thank you from Kuleshov. ","risks and challenges":"Growing a theatre company in this financial climate and engaging and attracting audiences to new work can be challenging. However, having the support of Theatre503, one of the most exciting and important new writing venues in London, has been invaluable. They have witnessed and nurtured the growth and development of Kuleshov, and continue to give us their support, which fills us with confidence that our work is important and should be shared . We believe in the importance of making and supporting new writing and giving our own generation of writers a voice. We are committed to establishing Kuleshov as a platform for new and important work for the long term./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"jelly-beans-at-theatre503","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"3213.3489284","backers_count":15,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":2488144,"background_color":null,"project_id":2488144,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1461669383,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/438/618/90a68c697a6698b1d359203356a77baf_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463761199&auto=format&q=92&s=b9983ee4b8f5776a95ce12d1adfc1235","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/438/618/90a68c697a6698b1d359203356a77baf_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463761199&auto=format&q=92&s=b9983ee4b8f5776a95ce12d1adfc1235"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Help get Jelly Beans to the Theatre503 stage.

Then the participants will produce a creative response to these issues.I WANT TO: raise self-awareness, galvanise discussions, inspire new ways of thinking, boost confidence, and promote creativity! The workshop will run Monday to Friday during a school holiday.

After hearing that I was missing a creative outlet in my life, Jamie suggested writing and the first few pages of my story were written.Almost 4 years later, in an acting  class at LifeBook Acting, run by Allen Levin, I brought some of that material and performed it in front of the class. The response was so positive and encouraging ,that I immediately got back to the writing and completed what now is a one-man-show./////With the help of Yafit Josephson, a fellow actress and performer/co-writer/co-producer of the critically acclaimed One-Woman Show \"NEW EYES\", I was introduced to Sammie Wayne, IV. An award winning director that came on board and took the writing to a whole new level.My life partner, Oscar Ibarra, asked to join as the producer, and the dream team was formed.Eight workshop shows later, almost 300 people have seen the show, and the reviews were raving:/\"I laughed, and cried...

Butch","info":{"description":"What does it mean to be grey in a world that only recognises black and white?Five characters navigate life on the fringes as they grapple with gender definitions, whether by choice or by circumstance. At best, society disregards them. At worst, they are relentlessly harassed—even viciously bullied—for being different. Inspired by the true stories of women (and men) who relate to being butch, Pretty Butch examines feminine masculinity that is often hidden from everyday life and explores the diversity of butchness through the experiences of different people who defy gender conventions.Pretty Butch, an M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2017 commission, was developed in residence at Centre 42, under the Boiler Room and the Basement Workshop, a programme for new works and works-in-the-making.Pretty ButchVenue: Black box, Centre 42, SingaporeDate: 11th - 14th January 2017Click here for more information about the show Click here to purchase tickets for the showWhat Pretty Butch means to usThe label Butch is a problematic one. Traditionally, its connotations of hyper-masculinity seem to suggest a complete lack of femininity and hold people who subscribe to the label to unrealistic standards. However, our ideas of masculinity and femininity have evolved over the years. Is being butch only skin deep? Or does being butch point to something closer to the core of the individual?Based on interviews with people, research and personal experiences, Pretty Butch unravels what it means to be butch, and why perceptions of masculinity and femininity still hold sway in our world today. This project aims to honour butch identifying humans, celebrate the uniqueness of butch identity and maintain the visibility of the community.Through a style of theatre that is intimate, the performance aims to challenge the audience’s assumptions about butchness, allowing different audience members to find their own entry points and draw their own conclusions from watching the show. The production is driven by a very human need for love and acceptance. We hope that this production touches people, whether they identify with being butch or not.About our team///Meet the Pretty Butch team!                                  (From L to R: Henrik, Richelle, Farah, Shannen, Fadhil, Deonn, Liting)///We are a group of freelancing professional theatre-makers who have each brought our own unique styles to collaborate on this work which deals with issues very close to our hearts.Written and Directed by \t\tTan Liting Performed by \t\t\tDeonn Yang, Fadhil Daud, Farah Ong, Henrik Cheng, Richelle South, and Shannen TanLighting Design by \t\t\tHelmi Fita Sound Design by \t\t\tJing Ng Production Stage Manager\t\tMerissa Tang Assistant Stage Manager\t\tNatasha MayPlaywright and Director - Liting works full time as a theatre practitioner with an interest in devising performance from personal stories.

Having come from a strongly rooted background in theatre, she is now exploring the cross-disciplinary practice of photography and performance, which has materialized in her collaborative and solo performance art pieces. She feels that sometimes love makes us numb, culture turns us characterless and religion leaves us being faithless, so her personal practice navigates around their inter-relatedness and contradictions.Henrik Cheng - Henrik is a theatre actor/director/practitioner from New York City via New Orleans.

Carre: from Binghamton, NY to Provincetown, MA","info":{"description":"But we need YOU to help us get/there.  And we've got less than 5 DAYS to reach our goal!For the final show of our 2012/2013/season, KNOW Theatre, of Binghamton NY, produced the little-known and/rarely-performed Tennessee Williams play VIEUX CARRÉ. /Our production of VIEUX CARRÉ was a/success, word spread, and soon we got a call from the folks who produce The/Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theater Festival on Cape Cod in Massachusetts,/with an invitation we couldn’t refuse: “We’d like you to bring KNOW’s/production of VIEUX CARRÉ to our September 2014 Festival in Provincetown!”/////An invitation to perform for the/world at an international festival right here in the U.S. And only seven hours away!/For a small theatre like KNOW, going to Provincetown is a huge opportunity, and/because it won’t require expensive air travel, it’s actually within the realm/of possibility. The Festival’s invitation came with the offer of financial/assistance – enough to cover roughly one quarter of our expenses – and we’re/grateful to our new friends in Provincetown for their generous subsidy. We knew/we had little time to raise the other 75% of our production and travel budget,/but we took the plunge!  We said, ”Yes, we accept your invitation! KNOW/Theatre will be thrilled to perform at The Provincetown Tennessee Williams/Theater Festival!” We’ve got some serious fundraising/to do. /That’s where you enter the picture...","risks and challenges":"VIEUX CARRÉ has a big cast – ten actors – and the complexity of our production demands more than just a stage manager, so we’ve budgeted for two technicians as well.  Add the show’s director and the total comes to 14 – fourteen company members who will spend a total of eight days traveling to and from Provincetown and rehearsing and performing at the Festival.  Housing is being provided by the Festival, but meals are not – with the exception of buffet receptions on our first and last days in Provincetown.  /It’s been more than a year since our original production of VIEUX CARRÉ.  We’ve had to recast a few roles, including the hiring of two Equity actors from New York.  KNOW has never employed Equity actors before, and a guest artist contract, though modest in compensation to the actor, is a big step up in expenses for us.  /Our plan is to rehearse and perform VIEUX CARRÉ again, here in Binghamton, in late August and early September, closing here on Saturday the 20th and leaving the following Monday for Provincetown.  We’ll rehearse in our assigned space at the Festival all week.  We’re performing on the weekend, September 25th, and driving home to Binghamton on the 29th. /We are looking to Kickstarter to help us raise five to six thousand dollars to cover the following festival expenses for the 14 members of our cast and crew:/Transportation to and from Provincetown (more than 800 miles round-trip), and Meal Per Diems for 8 days at $40 per person (a modest allowance for a week in a major resort town during an international festival.)/HERE'S OUR BUDGET.../Van Rental \t$750 /Gas and Tolls \t$450 /Per Diems \t$4,480 / \tTOTAL \t$5,680 /OUR KICKSTARTER GOAL: $5,000 /While there’s plenty more we need to raise, we’ve set a modest Kickstarter goal to be sure we won’t fall short of the threshold necessary to be successful.  Beyond this $5,000 target, we’d appreciate any additional help you can give us.  /Our overall production budget, including the cost of remounting VIEUX CARRÉ in Binghamton, is nearly $20,000./Learn

Stage Presents \"The Importance of Being Earnest\"","info":{"description":"Gypsy Stage Repertory is a touring theatre company based in theDunedin, FL.  It is our mission to break the performing arts out of the confines of a theatre space and back into the world.  By performing in unconventional and nontraditional spaces, we can bring the art of theatre to a new audience who may not have been exposed to it otherwise.This season, Gypsy sticks to that mission with a production of Oscar Wilde's classic romantic farce \"The Importance of Being Earnest,\" like you have never seen it before. In a world that is neither then, nor now, bosom buddies Jack and Algernon are determined to find true love, no matter how many lies they must tell.  It's big.  It's loud. It's gay and debonair. And its covered in techni-color glitter.

We are a community and a family.  We do not have a home performance space but rather travel around making every place a performance space.  This does create some challenges particularly for a large cast, period play like Wilde's \"Earnest.\" All the scenery, props, costumes, and necessary equipment to operate the show must be compact and transportable.  But production director Brianna Larson and Technical director Daniel Hayes believe that constraints such as these can also be the greatest source of inspiration and creativity.  They challenge us to discover new ways of producing work without sacrificing its integrity or production value.  Both Larson and Hayes have extensive training and professional experience in the technical and performing arts, and welcome the opportunity to break out of the traditional theatre mold and discover something entirely new./For this particular production we are attempting to create a world that pays homage to the aristocracy of Victorian England: The luxury, the grandeur, the ceremony.  With out sacrificing that vision, we must also create something that is collapsable and transportable.  Our solution: Trunks.  Old, ornate, refurbished trunks create the furniture of the scene and, on a functional level, provide a wealth of storage space for props, costumes, and necessary equipment./Victorian Era clothing of the 1880s is intricate, decadent, and expensive to recreate authentically, but crucial to the world that \"Earnest\" exist. To overcome this challenge, we looked to an era of the not-so-distant past for help- the 1980s.  To create Victorian Era garb, we are repurposing 1980s prom dresses which are surprisingly similar in shape and style to the clothing of the Victorian Era.

It's a piece that aims to shed light on issues surrounding mental health in the context of modern living./“Monday morning. I survived the weekend.” /  Honest, raw, and with sharply observed humour, this is an account of a woman’s struggle with her painful past, inadequate present, and her unquenched desire to find happiness whilst living with a mental illness.  This vibrant, fast-paced piece comes to life through frank, witty storytelling that tells us of music filled tube journeys, self obsessed friends and spiralling nights outs in this constantly evolving and sometimes stifling city of London./CTS is a beautifully poetic and bold piece of uncompromising and urgent theatre.  This production aims to give a voice to those muted, those who need to be heard./ 10% of all ticket sales will be donated to The Amy Winehouse Foundation which the production proudly supports- www.amywinehousefoundation.org ABOUT THE THEATREThe Hope Theatre's artistic director Matthew Parker proudly champions new writing in this fringe venue that describes itself as 'the little theatre with big ideas.' It is also one of the few venues that are committed to the fringe agreement, guaranteeing actors, stage managers and lighting designers receive at least the minimum wage. Each production must also have a one to one with Equity to ensure everyone is happy and that the project is running as planned. HOW YOU CAN HELPThis is a self funded production and we have been able to cover the initial costs thus far but we need your help!  As you can imagine the costs of putting on a theatre production are high, and your generous contribution to this play will help directly towards paying our ACTOR, the THEARTRE HIRE, REHEARSAL SPACE, SET, BUILD and PROPS.The amount we are looking to raise is the minimum required to put this play on the stage in front of an audience. However, with greater contributions we will hope to take this play further a field. This is not a vanity project for us, we are passionate about the subject matter and want to take this play as far as we can to encourage discussion around mental health. The more funds we raise, the further we can take and spread our message./Whether you want to donate a 'High Five', or pledge to have the production come to you, we hope you'll find a donation level that will suit your pocket. Check out the pledges on offer, and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions. THANK YOU! Scott, Chantelle, Maya and all the CTS team :)","risks and challenges":"As with any theatre production there are potential risks involved, from designing to selling the show. However, we have a strong team with a wealth of experience who have been able to create an imaginative piece of work that we hope will make great viewing for our audience.  /We appreciate that this is a subject that requires sensitive handling, and have been careful to present the writers voice (as this is autobigraphical) with authenticity.  In addition we have also been researching the subject and have presented a sharing of the play after a workshop in order that we would recieve feedback to make the necessary changes to enhance the piece./This is a new company, however, members of the team have worked together in the past and everyone involved is passionate about the subject matter and have given their all every step of the way./Deadlines have been set and met to ensure as smooth a process as possible, with everyone contributing and sharing ideas./We are excited for the opportunity to present work around a topic that needs urgent discussion, in an incredibly reputable theatre that supports new writing.  We are excited to show what can be done in a black box with a lot of imagination, talent and heart./THANK YOU again for taking the time to look at our project and supporting 'Cancel the Sunshine'.

The program will kick off with a one-night-only staged reading of a play accompanied by live acoustic music, concluding with a possible discussion of play with audience members. The night will he held in a historic venue in Montclair, and is meant to be kept \"no frills,\" needing only actors to bring the words to life.  Both local artists and established AEA professionals from NYC have volunteered their time to perform. We begin with Twelfth Night at the end of May 2015 (to hopefully be included in the festivities of 'May in Montclair'), and the goal is to eventually make the series an ongoing one, featuring a different play each month or so. This is celebration of Shakespeare's work and the cultural community of Montclair, which has always had an appreciation for the arts, but currently has little professional theatre available.The series will follow a similar format to that of Project Shaw, a popular staged reading series based in NYC (http://gingoldgroup.com/) but will focus on the work of William Shakespeare.In a concert-style staged reading, plays are read by the actors with the script in hand with very limited staging. The emphasis is on the language and on the actors' ability to bring the characters to life without costumes, sets, or movement. How You Will HelpDonations/Funding will help us secure a suitable venue for the series (Montclair Women's Club, Van Vleck House & Gardens, the Commonwealth Club, among others, are under consideration). Donations will also contribute toward the travel stipends required for Actors' Equity Association members coming to Montclair from NYC to perform. This ensures that we can have the highest caliber professional talent involved in this project. Our goal is to continue this reading series and potentially register as a non profit organization in the future. In doing so, we can expand our programming and outreach. Your donations will help us as we launch ourselves! ","risks and challenges":"Launching a theatre project is an extremely difficult task, and many companies have struggled to stay afloat in Montclair due to high venue rents and expenses. It is our goal to finally find a way bring theatre to this community at a low cost. We are in communication with the Montclair Public Library and the Van Vleck House & Gardens as we look for a home for this series moving forward into the future, and it is our hope that their support will make all the difference!/Learn about accountability on

Forever at The Hope Theatre","info":{"description":"About us...Tangled Thread Theatre Ltd. is a new theatre company dedicated to promoting and developing new writing and new talent in theatre. We have recently joined Equity's Professionally Made Professionally Paid campaign, becoming one of the first theatre companies to sign an in-house agreement with the union, committing ourselves to fair pay for all actors and creatives working on our projects. This is particularly important for us, as we hope to use almost entirely new graduates for all of our productions, providing them with crucial paid work and an opportunity to showcase their talents early in their career without having to pay for it or work for free.Our first production, 'Close To You', explored body image and the notion of fame in young women. It premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, receiving 5 star reviews, securing us a limited tour and a transfer to the Southwark Playhouse in London.Our next project is a brilliant piece of new writing by young playwright Abrahan Arsis, exploring the psychology of family. 'Only Forever' is a claustrophobic and intense play that asks audiences how far you would go to protect your family. We have just secured a venue for the play at The Hope Theatre in Islington, and have started putting together a talented company of young creatives to direct and design the show, and will soon start looking for the perfect cast from the many actors graduating form Drama Schools this Summer.As a new company we are currently dependant on financial support to enable us to pay all of our company properly and still put on a thrilling and exciting show that audiences will love.What we will spend it our funding on...The majority of our budget will be spent on our Cast and Creative's salaries as we are committed to paying everyone who works with us a fair wage for their talent! But there is still plenty more to spend money on...Cast and Stage Manager salaries = £3899.50Creatives/Crew salaries = £1170Marketing = £500Costume/Props/Set = £400Insurance = £100Reserve (for any scary surprises) = £500","risks and challenges":"Our biggest challenge is going to be raising the funds to pay our company. However it is paramount for us that no-one will be underpaid, and undervalued for the work they provide. We are 100% committed to fulfilling this promise./Theatre is a risky business, but that is what makes it so engaging and exciting...so while there may be risks in our process, we will be relishing in them!/Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"only-forever-at-the-hope-theatre","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"1384.8562069","backers_count":30,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":1966613,"background_color":null,"project_id":1966613,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1434635146,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/171/789/5a2ed65f5e4e0f3219ae8320c3964d0b_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463739481&auto=format&q=92&s=963296c075eb284fa0495ac6740544b2","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/171/789/5a2ed65f5e4e0f3219ae8320c3964d0b_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463739481&auto=format&q=92&s=963296c075eb284fa0495ac6740544b2"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"An intense new play exploring how far you would go to protect your family.

Barrie's classic story has stuck with us for almost a century, and now Open Space Arts would like to put their own spin on this landmark play.Open Space Arts is a 25 year old non-profit community theatre in Reisterstown, Maryland committed to bringing families together through low cost and accessible art.  We believe that art should be for everyone.  Last year, we successfully funded our art nouevea inspired production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  This year, we need help in continuing to produce high quality theatre for the community. With your help, we can create a beautiful and memorable Peter Pan that will delight audiences and give people a chance to create theatre together.While we have set our minimum goal at $1,000, our ultimate goal is to raise $4,000 to cover all of the costs of the production.If we reach $2,000... we will throw an opening night reception for our backers with cake and other delicious goodies.If we reach $3,000...we will send an exclusive backstage video to all of our backers.If we reach $4,000... all of our backers will receive an Open Space Arts button!We will be performing Peter Pan at the St. Mary's Theater in Hampden, MD on February 20th, 21st, and 22nd.  Thank you for helping Open Space Arts!  We will see you in Neverland.Can't come to the show?  No problem. We have provided some great reward incentives to those who do not live in the Baltimore area.  Please read each reward description carefully.","risks and challenges":"Theatre can be a challenging business but we know that our experience as artists will help us overcome any challenge. One setback might be time management. We have a lot of costumes and props to make. We also are working with a very small budget and may find our funds don't quite fit our needs. However, we have a group of very dedicated volunteers who will stop at nothing to get things done. We have years of experience working with time and money constraints.

everything is always \"what celebrity is doing this, what Pokemon is where, who is dating who, what disaster is happing now\", and it is all just a bit overwhelming and to be quite honest, depressing.Our idea is centered around creating a simple, user friendly app designed solely around sharing your adventures and encouraging people to get out and see the world. Whether you are a world traveler, sharing your adventures in South East Asia, or the casual hiker who wants to share your favorite local trail, this app will be for you.///Concept renderings///The name, and final functionality are a moving target, but what we can promise is a fun, interactive, relaxing and uplifting user experience. The definite functions are:/A social platform that allows you to share your adventures with other users on a macro or micro level. On a macro level, you can share pictures, either geo tagged or not. Brief descriptions if desired. Basically share as much or as little as you want. On a micro level, you can geo tag photos, share trail maps, tag hot spots, and more!/Users will be screened for authenticity, no bots, no spam, no fake users asking if you'd like to help their wealthy uncle wire his millions of dollars into your bank account. Security and privacy is a core goal./We WILL incorporate some sort of \"Give Back\" opportunity in our app that will give users the opportunity to donate to preservation efforts around the world. We will not shove it down your throat, but this is an important mission for us./Our Process if Funded:1. Functionality LayoutInvest a lot of time into going through all the details and find the right people who can translate Programmer to Civilian and vice versa.Go through every single screen and understand how all parts of the app interact with each other to ensure a great user experience.2. DesignOnce the functionality and user experience is PERFECT, we will focus on the design.We are working with best in class designers to come up with a great look, comfortable feel, and a fun experience.3. TEST, TEST, AND RE-TEST. 4. Going Live- Once funded, we hope to be live just 6 months later.We will start by submitting our app to the iTunes and Android stores – icons, descriptions, etc. Once live, we will market our app to build its user base.","risks and challenges":"Risks and Challenges: /-Competition: We recognize that their is a great deal of social media competition in the market place and we need to differentiate ourselves. By create a unique user experience centered on a particular life style, we hope to capture users. We are not centered on taking users away from current platforms, we hope to be an addition to those platforms./-User Base: As our app will be user based, we need to make sure that our marketing plan is centered around the types of users we hope to capture, \"the adventurer\". We will team up with outdoor sporting good manufactures and encourage them to promote our app in exchange for non intrusive ad space in our ap./-Final Execution: We know we MUST deliver a user experience that is simple, friendly and fun.

Proven methods developed by one of the UK’s top training centres on your smartphone.//////WHY?/Imagine how wonderful it would be to have your own personal dog trainer at your disposal whenever and wherever you need it./Our goal is to give all dog owners expert advice at their fingertips so they can enhance the relationship with their dog using a proven programme based around education, play and health. We want to share our knowledge through our app Dog Trainer In Your Pocket.//////A well trained dog results in a happy dog. By giving more people a training tool that is always with them, we hope to improve an owner’s understanding of their dog and thus improve their dogs' behaviour in society./We believe that the ever-increasing number of uncontrollable dogs being abandoned or given up for rehoming, is partly due to a lack of understanding of the importance of education in a dog’s routine. Our app will be an attempt to address this issue by sharing our years of experience with dogs./WHO?/Conceived and driven by Mark and Gillian Thompson, owners of The Dog House, the UK's leading activity holiday and training facility for dogs. Created and brought to life by Leo Learning (previously Epic), a global provider of e-learning technologies. /This powerful combination of expertise will produce a unique and user friendly training tool.///////'Time spent at the Dog House has been an integral part of the development of a long-living and well-behaved dog. For over fifteen years our dogs have spent considerable amounts of time with Mark and his team, and every time they come home healthy, happy and full of energy – and looking a million dollars!' -Chris Sanderson/WHY KICKSTARTER?//We believe that through the Kickstarter platform we can reach and engage an audience beyond the existing loyal devotees of The Dog House. /For us, this is just the beginning of building a community around The Dog House, which will develop into something far greater than the app itself./THE APP///Will be simple and easy to navigate using//Large, rich, clear images///A high-end look-and-feel///Excellent use of video and animated graphics///Simple and clear tutorials covering a large range useful training tips and troubleshooting advice for common problems.///////This won't be a standard app. It requires a large amount of high-quality video production, photography and local resources, as well as complex back-end development. Self-publishing a project of this scope is a major undertaking.//As well as funding the cost of the build of the app itself, the money we raise will also be used for a marketing campaign, promoting the app to users around the world. Any surplus funds raised will be used towards creating videos for our own Youtube channel and the building of future bolt on modules for the app.////Our hope is to build a community of dog lovers who share our belief that educating your dog is the most important element of responsible dog ownership. We hope to create a platform on which owners can benefit from our experience, but also share their own ideas and tips to one another. / ","risks and challenges":"One of the biggest challenges we will face is not the build of the app (we have total faith in the expertise of Leo Learning to produce a great product) but the amount of content that we can include in this first edition. We see this initial app as the first of a series of training apps and are keen to have feedback from our users to guide us towards the subjects we cover next. /We also plan in time to have a website and You Tube channel where again we will be covering the subject matter that is too complex or lengthy to include in an app format./Regarding rewards, we are limited to the number of training courses we can fulfil at any one time, so will have to treat those on a first come first served basis. If that top level of reward is oversubscribed we will provide an interim solution of one to one training for owner and dog until we can confirm the date of a course./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"dog-trainer-in-your-pocket","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/apps?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"47720.03325672","backers_count":137,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":2138340,"background_color":null,"project_id":2138340,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1443008099,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/261/246/9f8860e4e38cfd07d4c1c67a4cdcf403_original.png?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463747585&auto=format&q=92&s=26d3e30afe829b3c92614b30b729b9e1","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/261/246/9f8860e4e38cfd07d4c1c67a4cdcf403_original.png?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463747585&auto=format&q=92&s=26d3e30afe829b3c92614b30b729b9e1"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"A practical, easy to use dog training app, developed by experts with 20 years experience.

Long School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences at the University of Pacific, I get exposed to a lot of patients at our free health fair outreach events and in the pharmacy. This allows me to witness the tolls that smoking can take on the body and on a patient's overall health. I started the Quit Smoking Project in order to explore new ways of using technology to help lead to positive patient outcomes. My long term goal is to take what I learn from making an iOS app for smoking cessation and apply that knowledge to other disease states in the future, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. What sets this application apart from every other application is that it was developed with the driving force of research in mind. The application is developed from the ground up to be used as a research tool. It is true that there are other smoking cessations apps on the iOS App Store, but they were not designed to help push forward the collective knowledge on health care. We live in a world surrounded by technology, such as smartphones, and many different research groups are focusing on why this may be having a negative effect on our health, but the end goal should be finding ways of making this technology have positive effects on our health. The goal of this project is not just providing smoking cessation for the patient, but it is also to create momentum that will drive scientists and health care providers to create even more innovative patient oriented applications that have a positive effect on the patient's well being. If I am able to show positive results with my research, then I can provide a model for future projects to push innovation even further with personalized technology driven health care. /////How is it different?The largest differentiating factor of this application for the patient is that this app is based off a well established algorithms, such as the RxForChange algorithm, in order to aid the patient in the first, and often most difficult step of quitting, which is deciding the correct path they should take. Most applications currently assume the patient is able to decide the correct nicotine replacement therapy on their own after deciphering all of the information about each product, their side effects, and contraindications. I believe that these are false assumptions in most cases. This application will actively guide the patient through 5-8 questions and then based on their answers, it will present a product that best fits their lifestyle and current health conditions in order to give the patient the best opportunity to quit. It will also give the patient quick access to the product information, such as detailed directions, side effects, and contraindications. The application also allows the patient to set a quit date in order to remind them that they set a goal to quit. With informed consent, all of this data will be de-identified, as described under HIPAA regulations, and then collected for research purposes.The ResearchSpecifically, in this research project, the goal will be to:/Track the success of the application in guiding the patient to the correct nicotine replacement therapy/Determine if the patient sticks to their quit date after using the app/Assess if the app is effective in aiding the patient in quitting smoking by checking back in after a set amount of time, such as two weeks. /I am also collecting data for many other endpoints to help assess the efficacy of the mobile application. The IRB proposal will be submitted to the Board at the University of Pacific in Stockton.What about privacy?I have also derived a way to do this meaningfully with de-identified data to protect the privacy of the patient. This means that no information is every transmitted that can tie you to any of the research data. This will be verified by the University of Pacific IRB upon submission of my research proposal. What if I don't want to be in the research project but still want to use the app?If you do not provide informed consent, then you still have full access to the app and all its benefits without any of your information being collected for the research project.What will the money be used for?The money will be used for all projected costs that will be associated with the successful launch of the product. These include, but are not limited to:/Developer Registration Fees/New Mac OS X computer (current one is on its last legs)/Private and Secure Server Costs (de-identified data will need to collected for at least 1 year)/and other smaller costs","risks and challenges":"There are risks and challenges associated with every Kickstarter project, but I will do everything I can in order to help minimize these./One of the challenges is coding this application while attending Pharmacy school, however, I have been able to manage my time appropriately and should be able to complete the project during my summer break. /Another large challenge is coding the app on my current aging laptop, this challenge will be eliminated with a successful Kickstarter./A potential risk is the denial of the IRB approval by the University of Pacific. I have sought to minimize this risk by seeking guidance from several faculty members in creating the best possible proposal. If the research proposal is still release the application to the public, but remove all of the research aspects of the project, so that users will still have the benefit of using the app to help them

We’ve planned Divvy from the ground up to avoid as many issues as possible, but we can’t always ensure smooth sailing. Anyone with a software background knows that bugs and delays are inevitable, and as such we’ve budgeted some extra time for such occurrences./Kickstarter backers have the unique opportunity to be an integral part of this development process. By gaining early access to a Divvy Beta test, we hope you can help us iron out any issues before launch./A large unknown for us, however, is how big Divvy will end up. As a company we will have to grow with our product. As our user base expands, we may find the need to take on additional staff, and spend on our backend architecture and server space to keep up. This is a cost that we can only guess at, but we’ve run the numbers and we’re confident we can keep up with your demands./Finally, we cannot guarantee that Apple will accept Divvy onto the App Store first time around. This is always an unknown for app developers, but we've taken steps to mitigate our chances of failure, and we hope we can get Divvy into your pocket and your housemates pockets as soon as possible./Backing our young team is a vote of confidence in our future and in what Divvy can become, and we know we can deliver. It is our hope that, with your support, Divvy can be released on time or even ahead of schedule, and we’ll be doing everything in our power to make that happen./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"divvy-divide-and-conquer-your-shopping","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/apps?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"741.21524425","backers_count":9,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":1607007,"background_color":null,"project_id":1607007,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1425915888,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/988/526/19f1bc927cc0525fe2caaf4be7f6f000_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463721849&auto=format&q=92&s=0d407f2dfe21e0873d42e2b3444fadf5","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/988/526/19f1bc927cc0525fe2caaf4be7f6f000_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463721849&auto=format&q=92&s=0d407f2dfe21e0873d42e2b3444fadf5"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Divvy is a shared shopping list for the whole house.

The app features calendar events, poly chat, to do lists, agreements, maps as well as ways to keep your poly family/lovers organized by family category and relationship status. It's the best app to use for managing all of your relationships! /////The app was launched in 2014 on iOS and since then, the demand for an Android version has been non-stop. This demand is very exciting for us but also challenging because this app is a niche product. We have not and do not expect to recoup the money that has been spent creating this app. We didn't create this app to make money, we created it for our community. We wanted to provide a way for people in multiple relationships to live their life instead of spending countless hours trying to maintain it with multiple apps. The Poly Life is a single app that can maintain relationships with ease. We are now asking for YOUR HELP to raise 50% of what we will need in order to create the Android companion to the iOS app. You've asked for it and we want to deliver! But we can't do it without you. So please help us spread the word and share this with everyone you know. We must reach at least $5,000 in order to build and launch the app on Google Play. This is an expensive app and together we've raised half the funds to build it but we need your help to raise the other half. This is our last chance to get the Android app released.  By selecting one of our rewards on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us fund the app but you are pre-ordering The Poly Life and securing a download code once it's released. Please note: if the app gets funded, we will be sending our backers Google Play promo codes to download the app. Google Play allows 500 promo codes per quarter so please make note of our rewards. FIRST QUARTER means you will receive the app as soon as it is completed and live on the Google Play store (by Spring 2017). SECOND QUARTER means you will receive the app as soon as the promo codes reload for us (by Summer 2017). THIRD QUARTER means you receive the app as soon as the promo codes reload for us a third time (by late Summer to early Fall 2017). Of course, we wish we could make all of the promo codes immediately available but that's unfortunately just the way Google Play is currently set up. Keep in mind just a few short months ago, Google Play didn't even offer promo codes so the fact that they do now is a huge plus and is making this Android launch using Kickstarter's help a real possibility for us now! To learn more about The Poly Life, please visit the following:http://thepolylife.comhttps://www.facebook.com/thepolylifeapp/https://twitter.com/ThePolyLife","risks and challenges":"The Poly Life on Android is an extremely low risk project. We have already successfully created the iOS version so we are taking everything we've learned and applying that to the Android version with a very talented development team. /The only true risk associated with funding this app is that although we will try our absolute hardest to get the app finished by or before Spring 2017, there may be unforeseen challenges during programming that cause the timeline to shift a little.

The need to update a status, check messages, or check in, can limit the time you are spending with the people close to you and possibly reduce productivity at work. The app \"Social Addiction\" is an app special directed to those who want to limit or quit the amount of time they spend on social media sites. The Social Addiction app works by charging the user a fee each time they login or spend a set amount of time on a site. The fee that can be anywhere between $0 - $100 is transferred automaticly to either the users savings account or to a non-profit organization of their choosing. A ratio can even be set up to determine how much of the fee goes into their savings account and how much goes to charity. The development plan for the Social Addiction app requires time and programming of secure pathways between banks and non profit organizations. As well and getting the Social Addiction App the exposure it needs to find the people it can help the most. I plan on starting by introducing the app to the Apple App store for iPhone and iPad first and then branching out to other devices from there.I strongly believe that with your support that is project can be a huge success, as well as help thousands of people at the same time.","risks and

SLAPPRSLAPPR is is the idea of shouting out anything into the world. Since the world is already connected through internet, we wanted to create an app which uses that connection for something good & positive. We came out to this social experiment we called SLAPPR, when we saw someone slap another in order to get their attention.When you've completed your message in SLAPPR, just press send and SLAPPR sends your message to a random SLAPPR user in the world. For now, we've chosen to keep the app's language english.Sending slapps equals receiving slapps. When you receive a slapp you'll get notified on your smartphone by sound and notification bar. When you open your slapp, you'll only see the slapp's content with two options; a happy face and sad face. /(you'll earn the privilege of seeing where the message came from later)If the message triggered anything positive, you press the 'smile button'/If you didn't like the content of the message, press the sad button. If you don't 'judge' your received slaps, you won't be able to send any. When opening the app, you'll have to judge your received messages first.We want to keep the app balanced & minimal with usability and performance as high as possible./When you start the SLAPPR app, it'll open the 'send' screen by default. Here you can type in anything, and send./If you slide to the left or right, you can access other menu's.Here's a demo of a first encounter with SLAPPR:///////You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.//////Play////////////////////////////Replay with sound//////////Play with  sound/////////////00:00///00:00////////////////////////////////Other menu's1. Your statsHere you see your karma level and earned privileges. /The karma concept was added to create a form of gamification and motivation to send 'good' messages. Obviously 'good' is subjective as someone elsewhere might not like the message you would like, but the karma concept limits the trolls/spammers among us.The Karma concept works a following:/- At start, you'll be able to send and receive one slapp a day, to one person./  also the length of your message is limited to 144 characters/- If someone liked your message you'll see your karma-level grow/- If you reach various karma-levels, you'll earn or loose the following privileges:/\t- sending/receiving more than one message a day/\t- sending longer messages (144+)/\t- adding a photo/\t- sending audio/\t- re-slapp received messages/Note: you'll never be able to directly send back a message to someone, receivers will never see the author of a message.2. Your 'Slappmap'/This is a map of the world, showing lines from your hometown or region to other places in the world, these lines represent the trails of your messages.There's no inbox; SLAPPR is only a messaging service, no storage. To compensate this we'll add a 'social media share' button, so you can share/save your message directly.An important concept is re-slapping, this means someone likes the slapp so much he/she is willing to risk his own karma for it and slapps it forward to other users, the amount depending on his/her karma of course. This is risky for the re-slapper, so the re-slapper will be also be rewarded for likes.3. SettingsThis is a regular settings menu, here you can:/Set app theme; male, female or transgender /Limit the amount of slaps you want to receive per day (this amount equals the amount of slapps you can send.) /Sound control/Notification control///////////The back-end is powered by a basic, but high-performance web-server with a highly scalable NoSQL database as the primary datastore. On the front-end we have the basics of the Android client. But there's still a lot of work to be done. We did this in one week. The visual designs are OK, but we're not expert designers nor do we currently have the budget to get help on it. So with your help we could really make the app shine!/////GOALSAdditional extensions: /iOS version/Social media share features/If we achieve our goal of €5.000 we will:/Finish the app with all the additional features + features suggested by our backers./Continue on developing the app & publishing data generated by it's users/Make the app available for iOS devices/Get help to finish the graphic design/Get help to brand the app/Follow us on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Slappr/918164928198734","risks and challenges":"A social experiment/SLAPPR is a social experiment. The purpose of SLAPPR should be open for interpretation. It would be disappointing to discover that people use SLAPPR for commercial or hateful purposes. Obviously, there are ways of limiting people from doing this, but we will only implement such changes if proven necessary./Changes & development/We are very curious what people do with SLAPPR, therefore, we will share certain data with our backers and/or the world. Based on these results & feedback we could continue developing the app. Developing this app takes a lot of time, since we are a small business./User generated content /Our goal is to make SLAPPR available to everyone on as many devices as possible. But like every app, it needs to be promoted. Without users, we won't have input to continue developing. That's one of the reasons we're raising money. Without budget we're limited to writing websites and blogs about SLAPPR. We fairly hope that our backers will also contribute by spreading the name and the idea online & offline./Android & iOS/We've programmed this app with great love and care. For the people that don't know; programming for Android is done in another language then for example iOS. Especially when you want to achieve maximum performance. Programming takes time, therefore we've started this project for the Android users. (since Android is market leader) If we reach our goal, we'll buy a developers license from Apple and start building the app for iOS.

Our Custom Transitions is an application for android that will give people the ability to customize their background by giving them the option to automatically cycle through a set of images that the user picks for their backgrounds. Allowing you to see new images all the time and enjoy all of your images instead of having them sit inside your album under dozens if not hundreds of other images and are rarely being seen.How it works The user will be able to select from different option settings to have their images cycle from. Some of these options will be by time, when the phone shakes, when the phone locks, the temperature of your local area, holidays, seasons, dates, and when you receive/send a phone call or text./When the user selects one of the options above, they will be asked to select an existing album or to create a new one. If you create a new album you will select all the images you want to cycle as your background. Your Options Time-This option will allow you to pick a time of day or duration in which the background will change. Phone Locks-Every time your phone locks, your background will change. Receive or Send a text/call-You can set up so the background will change when you receive and/or send a text/call or any combination of those such as having it cycle when you receive a call but not a text and have it change when you send a text but not when you make a call. Outside Temperature-The Background will change depending on the temperature outside. You can create multiple albums for various temperature such as a hot album, warm album, perfect day album, cold album, freezing album, etc. Dates-Using this option, the user will be able to select any date they wish or even a range of dates and then name it and select their album. Holidays-The user will be able to select any holiday and have their album play through that holiday. Seasons-You can set up albums for every seasons. When the seasons change, so does your album, so does your background, automatically. Sub-Options Sub-options is the next step in customizing your transitions. After you pick an option, you will then be able to select a sub-option. Certain sub-options will only work with certain options. They are the same as the options that you see above but the sub-options will affect the option itself. For example, if you select Outside Temperature as your option you will then be able to choose the Time sub-option. So when your Hot album is selected you can have it transition how many times you want. Or you can select phone shake or phone locks, etc. Prioritizing You will be able to have more than one option active at once, but this could cause contradiction with your background. If you have the season option active and also a holiday, which one will play? So we will add a prioritizing system so you can rearrange on what you want to take priority.  For example you can have the season option on (Priority 3), with the holiday option (Priority 2), and the date option (Priority 1). The season option will play regularly, but then Christmas comes so your phone will start showing your Christmas album, but then you had a date set during the Christmas holiday, so during that day your phone will show the date option instead. When that day is over it will go back to the holiday option, when the holiday is over it will go back to the season option. What makes your app different from others? We allow a larger customization option for the users to ultimately customize the transition of your background. We will also be looking for new ways to help you customize your phone even further. We look forward to hearing from the community to hear what they have to say and their ideas that they would like to see implemented into the application.","risks and challenges":"Every project will have its bumps in the road, but with the skill of the team i picked to work on this project and with your help, we will be able to fix it with no problem./We will address any problem and fix it.

ϟ The Perfect Challenge App– Because Sky is The Limit!","info":{"description":" /////HITME is the go-to app if you want to accomplish things & push yourself beyond your limits. With the app, you are able to :/Send challenges to friends, family & others in the world./Receive challenges from us every day./Receive challenges from people around the world & accomplish things like never before./Share the challenges you’ve done with just one friend, all of them, or even the world./View & like people’s accomplishments/Get points for the challenges you complete, as well as the likes you get from them./Compete with everyone, and have fun!////// //////  The world is filled with challenges everywhere; challenges that are just waiting to be completed. Sending someone on Mars & going on the fastest rollercoaster are some examples of challenges we could face right now. However, the difference between these two is simply that one has much more support than the other. It can be hard to accomplish something if we don’t have people that pushes us to do it. That’s why we’re creating HITME. Why not push ourselves beyond our limits more often? Let’s move & accomplish things while having fun! Big challenges shouldn’t be the only ones that we notice. With HITME, every challenge has people behind, supporting you. Let your friends challenge you, and you won’t be the only one to know what you accomplished anymore. Share it with the world and be proud of yourself! Remember, Sky is the limit. ///// ///// Everyone can do great things. Let’s help them by creating an app that pushes everyone beyond their limits while having fun. We want the people to be proud of themselves & to show the world their accomplishments. We can create a better place by bringing the community together & make every action count./////We are an experienced, dedicated, and confident team, ready to give our 200% on this project. Support HITME, and help us live our dreams & build something that could bring joy to the community. In fact, if you help us, not only you’ll bring a smile to our faces, but also in yours. We have great things prepared for our backers!///// /////The 36 000$ isn’t just an amount that we threw on Kickstarter. We thought about how we could make sure the app works. Here’s a representation of how we will distribute the amount:////// Kickstarter cost: First, a successful Kickstarter campaign has fees. Those fees are around 10% in total, which is $3 600. After that, there is the cost of the rewards. Since we have graphics designers skills, the cost is mostly time. However, there are some rewards that requires money for material (like shirts). Depending on the amount of backers we got, the amount needed will vary. However, we could estimate around $2 000, which makes a total of $5 600./// Development: To develop a fully functional app, fix the bugs & establish ourselves in the App Store, we need 6 to 9 months. We will need $28 800 to cover the 9 months cycle./// Marketing: When you’ve just finished a great new product, you get that awesome feeling. However, that feeling doesn’t stay for long if nobody knows about your product & as a result, people don’t use it. We are Marketing students at the University of Ottawa, so the HITME team will most likely be able to manage it. Nonetheless, since Marketing isn’t free, we’ll need to invest some money into that. The rest of the money will help cover the marketing cost and get HITME out there.////// ","risks and challenges":"Alright, let’s take a look at HITME and talk about its challenges. The first challenge would be obviously to extend our development team to complete the app. The second challenge would be to provide an app that meets users' expectations, and get widely adopted./The HITME team is pretty confident on resolving these challenges with our organization, our motivation & our experience. We believe we can make a great application that everyone will be able to enjoy./Just HITME, & you'll see.../that Sky Is The Limit!/Learn about accountability on

am sure that most of you have heard at least one person complaining about the fact that nowadays socializations happens only online. And, sadly, that or those persons are right and their reasons to complain are getting stronger as each day passes.I believe we reached a high peak in technology development, which is not necessarily a bad thing, because technology enriches our life style, but also makes us loose on the way a very important aspect of life: HUMANITY.//////And this is where mit comes in!/I do not want to say that this app will solve the humanity's problems, nor that will change the values we are already guided by, but I hope it will help the communities to encourage people to keep the values they already have and embrace./The idea behind the app is very simple: you sign in for an account by using your phone number, without leaving any extra data because we are not interested in your social and demographic data and turning people into targets, you confirm your number and you can start inviting the friends you have in your phone's agenda for a beer, juice, movie, so on. /////You can see in real time who confirms, you can chat with the friends that confirmed that will attend your event and you can upload photos from your event, photos that will be saved in an album in the app.//////Furthermore, you can see who is using mit from your agenda and you can suggest others to use the app.//////Mit's first version will be a very simple one, but if we find some financial solutions, we will improve this version with more complex options to achieve our main goal: to encourage the face to face meetings.","risks and challenges":"Mit's main challenge is to remind people that they are explorers, they were made to go out and find what the world is all about.  And, even though it sounds very easy, in fact, it's a dirty work because people got really lost in all the Social Media's virtual realities. /That is why we built a team made of a genuine explorer that got out ok from the Mongol Rally, a crazy marketing expert that hitchhiked from Anger, France to Bruxelles, Belgium, an open minded copywriter and an art that is a bit negativist, but that helps us to see the problems from a 360 degree perspective. /Together we are ready to anticipate why people won't go out and send them the proper messages that would make them take their life at the next level and enjoy the real experience in life./Learn about accountability on

how to create iPhone apps & games from start to finish","info":{"description":"There is still room for another dream come true!Opportunities are rampant, if you know what you're doing. Check out Flappy Bird and its clones in the Apple® App Store. Those applications are pretty successful. If you should choose not to go it alone, then just look at the job boards. Nearly three-quarters of the postings are mobile-related and one-third of them are seeking iOS developers. Plus, if you have something in the App Store with a 4-Star rating, your inbox will be heavily bombed by recruiters from nearly everywhere.Why am I making this course?When I first started learning iOS programming. I have no ideas where to start and what books to read./There are so many online courses on the internet. which one is providing the most accurate and reliable information?/After having few years real world iOS programming experiences. I went back to those books I read, courses I have taken. I have realized that I have been wasting 3 quarters of my time in learning some of those stuffs. /lots of those tutorials were either taking the wrong approach or using the very bad programming practices. /furthermore, most of those tutorial are fragmented and lack of serialization. /that's why this course come into play./I am trying to make this course just about to cover the enough key information in order for you to become a decent iOS developer./I am getting there. but, I do need your support though./Please help me finish this project!I am also thinking to make an iPhone & iPad app for this tutorial. So, you can learn from anywhere you go. the app is available to all backers. It will be free to download from app store, but login is required. You will get the login information once the KS campaign is successfully funded. /however,  I am not sure if apple allow me doing it. I would give it shot anyway. wish me lock!Android and other mobile phone users can access to this tutorial through mobile web.How this course differs from the rest?The greatest single advantage of this course is it's practical and pragmatic. For starters, you will learn from a highly experienced iOS developer with more than 50 apps published in the App Store under his belt . . . and you can learn from his experiences, good and bad. Next, this course will help cut you a clear path to the destination of your iOS app adventure. both video and text lessons from a variety of different angles giving you a better picture mastering iOS programming. The course provides 5 tutorial series governed only by your willingness to invest in yourself.Course ComponentsThe course has five components, each one locked to your level of investment.Level 1 Tutorial: Even at entry-level, this tutorial provides intensive information about the iOS app industry, including why you should build an iOS app or become a developer; profitable ways to build your app; the essential tools and programming languages you need to master; plus (and this is vitally important at every stage) how to become an iOS developer and submit your iPhone and iPad apps to the Apple App Store . . . and much more. Once you've completed this tutorial, you will have everything you need to be able to choose the correct tools and pick the smoothest path to your career as an iOS app developer.Level 2 Tutorial: This module focuses on iOS programming. The iOS library is huge, with around 7,000 APIs and still growing. Now, imagine trying to memorize each one of those 7,000 APIs. It's impossible. However, completing this course will give you an arsenal of tips and tricks on how to use any API the moment you see it.You will also learn various techniques on how to approach the hard programming problems so solving them becomes a snap. And when those problems do arise, you'll learn the best way to find the bugs and crush them. When you complete the course, you will be able to code a moderately complicated iOS application on your own.Level 3 Tutorial: This module is about generating ideas. We all have ideas, but how many of them are worthwhile? How many will turn users on, then trigger the download? The course will help you determine the viability of your iOS app by teaching you how to measure your ideas for feasibility, user appeal and profitability so you can make sure that developing them is worth your time and effort  . . . before you begin. You'll also learn some common design patterns so you can avoid your iOS app getting the dreaded 1-Star rating.Level 4 Tutorial: This module is all about visibility. You can create the greatest, slickest iOS app in the universe, but if no one can find it, if it doesn't show up early in the app store, you're doomed. All your hard work and investment is for nothing. This course can help you fix that. Those inside secrets professional developers use to improve their listings? The same ones they don't disclose on the Internet? They're yours now. because this information is that valuable, it is only available for backers at this level.In addition to that, I will throw a couple of hybrid app templates with detailed instruction of usage, It should get you up and running within 20 minutes. This module can plug into pretty much anything you could imagine. such as social networking, book, photo, video and even game applications and so on.Full version app examples: You get the actual source codes for real working iOS apps. This is an excellent way to learn by example, which is the best way to learn. Hands-on always trumps theory. This module gives you the opportunity to familiarize yourself with how the experts did, then you can duplicate in an exercise that's guaranteed to build your confidence so you can get to work on your own apps the moment you finish the course.Where do you take the course?The course is available online, 24/7/365. So you can learn at your own pace.When will the tutorials be delivered?The instant I surpass my funding goal, I will start uploading and updating the content on a daily basis.Who is Willie Shi?I, Willie Shi, have over 18 years experience in programming, including 6 years creating and developing iOS apps. I have published over 50 apps in the Apple App Store, you can find most of them from my website. worked for such top-tier companies such as Yahoo and graduated from UC Berkeley and Wuhan University.Why this course and why now?Simply stated, I wanted people to learn from my mistakes and use my successes to make their journey faster and easier. When I first started learning iOS, I had no idea where to start, what books to read or which courses to take. I could not find a single resource that tied everything together. Eventually, I found books and enrolled on courses from Stanford and Harvard. But there were still times when I got frustrated, especially when I began coding over 5,000 APIs from the iOS library, I struggled for a time until I figured out a way that I could blend all these disparate resources together painlessly. Once I did that, there was no more head-scratching and no more need to Google everything I coded. Objective C is now one of my strongest programming languages and I added it to my resume with pride.Today, I want to pass on my personal learning experiences and the shortcuts I found to others who are also eager to become an iOS developer quickly, easily and painlessly.What if the final funding exceeds your goal?You get the benefit. More backers means more content and bonus courses can be added based on the final funding amount.What if I want to support this project but don't wish to become an iOS developer?No problem. All support is welcomed. Just copy and paste the link below to your Facebook page and Twitter account. Then make sure you let me know you are helping to promote the project and I will friend you on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter . . . and tell the world about your entrepreneurial spirit.http://kck.st/1jprYBe.FAQ:Do you have a sample tutorials we can look?YES, due to the space issue, I have posted few Text Tutorials on my website, More are coming up soon. You can check them out from the link bellow.http://www.8land.org/iOS_programming/ks_iOS_tutorialCan we see some of your apps?of course, here are some of youtube videos I created early.http://youtu.be/C-Univ8PcI0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO8iAgRsA4Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wpq9AcwdOU&noredirect=1Questions/Comments?Drop me a note.

- the LAST photo app you will EVER need!","info":{"description":" ///// /In our day to day lives amazing things happen, incredible sights, phenomenal food, experiencing these all with our favorite people. Our moments create who we are and we want to create the ability to refresh our memories with these moments. Look back and recreate those feelings. We want the ability to commemorate our lives journaling these moments. We want this without limitations. For most of us our parents did just this. Every moment, every step, every accomplishment. For some of this, other moments happen that change the course of your life and you wish you had had these memories persevered./When I was a small girl, right in the midst of amazing feats and the promise of my future, I lost my mother to cancer when I was 4. My ONLY memories of those times are preserved with photographs. The moments we do have captured mean the world to me and bring back to life a smile and feeling that left all those years ago, but brings me right back into that moment. /After her passing day to day photographs become few and far between, they turned into vacation and events only photographs. After I lost my dad suddenly when I was 30, the ability to know more about my mother's life, his life and my own life were gone. /I want to preserve EVERY moment of my life, without limitation. Every smile and every tear, every proud moment and those that make you wonder, their goofy times, their serious times, the moments that make us a family and that make them their own people./PixstaVault™ was born out of necessity when one of these moments arose in my eldest daughter’s life. She had signed on with L’Oreal as one of their models. After all day prep, backstage memories and moments, it was time to prep for the stage. I asked for her phone as it was newer and I had assumed it had been plugged in all day and that she would had the forethought to empty her memory./As she placed her phone in my hand, she did have the battery required, but her memory was critically low. I then pulled out my phone which had sufficient room but with 15 mins of battery remaining. Her stylist was then asked if she could replace a model in the show, so she asked if I too could take photos for her! She said that her phone had incredible space on it, but her battery was also low. The odds were stacked against us. When you are under pressure it is hard to focus on quality. I honestly took as many as I could in the batteries duration for both phones, I was displeased with the outcome./I then began to ask people what was something that would change their lives, and from the answers I received – an app that could do it all and never tell ME what I could and could not do with my $1000 phone./So what is Pixstavault™ and what can it do? //////It is truly the FIRST EVER to incorporate all your photo taking, editing, sharing, storage and social media needs - ALL-IN-ONE! You TAKE your photos.You EDIT your photos, and if you are like me, this is a long tedious process going in and out of multiple apps, finding different filters, artwork, quotes, borders etc - NOT ANY MORE! We have doubled the basic minimum and are giving you ALL the options, with the option for SO much more!/////You want to SHARE your photos. Before it was straight to social media, fumbling with clouds in the sky, or tediously making group chats or groups on text to send multiple photos, with limitations./////Pixstavault™ offers you LIMITLESS sharing! Imagine being on assignment for work and you are taking photos and your boss needs them to be perfect? Imagine him receiving a copy every time you take one? Sending you automatic feed back? REAL TIME sharing without limitations? Imagine photographers, weddings, babies being born ... never missing something if you can't be there?You want to STORE your photos. As mentioned, fumbling through the clouds in the sky can be tedious, expensive. With our NEW web app software, when you download our app you make choices as to what to do when your phone gets low! Send them to your existing cloud, send them to our service, OR the best - send them home? Yes I said it - HOME! Whichever setting you choose it stays, and when the DEVICE LOW screen appears, you tap the logo and you miss nothing but 1 second. /////The last feature - OUR APP HAS FULL CUSTOMIZATION!/Yes, I did say that! YOU choose the colours, the format, YOU make the choices./You can choose how YOU see your photos/videos, how others see your photos/videos. /You can choose to have a \"timeline\"./You can choose to have a FEED./You can choose to turn options on or off./You can write things and make the decisions on who, what, how and when.////// Social Media currently controls how you view your world. Would you like that to change? Would you like to control the colours, the feel of the feed, if people can comment, like or share?Do you want your social media to be more social?Pixstavault™ has features that no other APP or media outlet has - we are solving the problem by giving you the rights to the solution. You get a say in what you post, how you post it, how others perceive it AND react to it!/////We will also be introducing a WEB APP + Business Branding!Its 2016! WE are giving YOU your life, memories, moments and world do with as YOU choose!  Having 100% control of your devices, memories + moments – and allowing the world or just your people to be a part of your journey, as it happens. /We saw a problem and we created a solution, in 2016, 2.5 trillion photos were shared or stored online, a 15 percent increase from the prior year. Three-quarters of this total were shared, and the remainder backed up online. It is estimated the number of photos shared online to be about 31 times the volume taken (let alone shared) in the 1990s, when about 80 billion were taken every year./80 billion photos – with most apps creating 2-8 copies, filling phones, people afraid of intrusive apps recording your location in order to help. So many different apps all in one, saving time, saving money and SAVING memories! So, there you have it! We need YOUR support to help us move onto the next stage! Over the past two years we have grass rooted, created, designed, developed and tested – now we need you to be of this amazing journey./Be apart of something revolutionary, be apart of change! ///Pixstavault™ - the LAST photo app you will EVER need! ////// ","risks and challenges":"We are asking for $100,000 to go towards further development, creation of our servers for our social media component and to offer 24/7 support./While we have gone to every effort to predict the best way for the APP to function across all platforms and how it will pertain to any problems that might arise.  /We are confident moving forward that once we have created the support team/staff we will be able to navigate and troubleshoot any problems.

speaks'","info":{"description":"About Eline?Eline is a care worker for the disabled people at ‘Ons Tweede Thuis’ (Our Second Home). In her work, existing assistive technology solutions have been an annoyance for years. They’re rigid and expensive, and they poorly fit the evolving needs of users and social workers.Eline started working with a new residential group and wanted to set up her name and photo on the speech computers that were already being used. Making the adjustments took up so much time and energy that she thought, 'there has to be a better way!'Her brother Mark worked at a company specialized in digital communications & user experience. Together, they conceived of ‘Eline Speaks’ and developed it. The speech app that turns an iPad into a full fledged speech computer. A revolutionary development in the world of assistive technology solutions!Innovation in mHealth'Eline Speaks' is originated in the workplace and developed 'bottom-up'. By combining existing hardware ( iPad ) with a clever & intuitive app we created a new product that contributes to more joy in life and better care. We focussed first on the wishes and demands of clients, parents & care workers instead of specialists, institutions and insurance companies. As a result, we have been able to get the product keeping up to the (changing) needs of users and at the same time keep it simple and intuitive to use.The next faseThe funding is for the next fase. Improve the UX of the app, make it multilingual & help people with disabilities communicate with ease for more joy in life and better care worldwide.More info http://www.elinespeaks.com/Free Trial  https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/id955777526","risks and challenges":"The risk is that the product is to 'cheap' for insurance companies & professional care advisors. An average speech computer costs 8,000 euro's. This App costs 100 euro's / year. We provide an 'Ikea' solution; Together we save money. We deliver a smart app for a very competitive price. You buy an iPad and install the app and you have a full fledged and user-friendly assistive technology solution./Learn about accountability on

We are not a big team but we have a BIG heart. Wonderful Mama has been my biggest dream and I am beyond thrilled at how much support we have received. I am going to be honest with you, we are 6 months in and its come to a point where we've invested all (and I mean ALL) we have into Wonderful Mama and we just need a little extra help to get to where we want to be. ///Read our interview with the lovely Ada Nicodemou///With your pledge we will be able to spread our vision of helping as many mums as possible feel the way they should about themselves: to feel valued, confident, inspired and supported. /We know how tough (but rewarding obviously ;)) it is being a mum so at Wonderful Mama all we want to do is give mums a little time between changing nappies and school drop offs to read our mag, feel inspired and know that they're not alone on this crazy journey. That's why we would love to create a Wonderful Mama app. With this, mums have easier access to our articles, they can get behind the scenes access to interviews, added tips and can stay in touch with other mums while they're doing it. /Some of the money will also go towards hiring a proper office (instead of just working in the corner of my living room where my kids are constantly climbing over me asking for Peppa Pig!) where we can work, plan, have business meetings, photoshoots, and knuckle down to see real growth for Wonderful Mama. We will also use some of the funding to enable us to travel to your area and host events so we can connect with mums from around the world.////Read our fitness tips for exercising with the family///Although we do not have a physical product to offer, we have some fantastic rewards for pledges given along with the BIGGEST THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. /Wonderful Mama is all about YOU as a mum, so if you feel inclined, I would be so honoured if you were to pledge towards being a part of our dream. I so appreciate you even taking the time to read this, and trust me I hate to be asking but we need your help to help other mamas feel the way they should./THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!/Emma x x x","risks and challenges":"Potential challenges or set backs may be in the development of our app. Projects have time lines and we are well aware that things can pop up out of the blue and delay things.

The children are stolen from their parents and are forced into beggary and child labor. We decided to bring a change and started to come up with suggestions. We want to develop a phone application which has the potential to solve this problem. It's important to understand that so many children are losing out on their childhood due to this. It has been going on since so many years and now this has to stop. We need crowd collaboration and having this application on every phone is important. We will be working hard and continuously to help families unite. Be the change what you want to see in the world !!!!!Why we need it?/Many children are stolen from their families. And sometimes go missing./We want to change that, we want to bring in the change. \"Let's do it\" is an application and service that will bring about a new future for many families.How does it work?/Here are the steps In the application: The parent or the relative of the missing child will upload the photo of the child. Anyone who sees a child beggar will take his or her photo and will upload to our database with the location. We will use facial recognition technologies to match the pictures in our database. When there is a match, the application will inform the relative about the known location of the child. This will enable the police authorities to locate the child. It's an Application of Hope. /The Application will provide hope to millions of people who have lost their loved ones in this crowded world. The Application is crowdsourced and requires constant crowd involvement./We will use innovative ways to involve the crowd to be a part of it./This phone application is worldwide so can be used in any part of the world successfully.TOGETHER WE CAN AND WE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE !!!!!","risks and challenges":"There are certainly few challenges. We need to have a world class application, so we will be working with the best experts in this field. We need constant maintenance of the server and the application, so the costs can be overcome by supporters and advertisers. We will need great face recognition technologies so we will be using the ones used by Google and Facebook. The eyes of a person don't change with time and this will be an important factor in this application to make the match even after several years. We are sure that this application will prove to be a very helpful tool for millions of families and will bring about a positive change to the lives of millions of children./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"lets-do-it-an-application-of-hope","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/apps?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"30.0","backers_count":3,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":2572805,"background_color":null,"project_id":2572805,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1466733172,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/845/527/b45c2130538b32d66b579c8f136f044e_original.PNG?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1467051754&auto=format&q=92&s=81b45c8c1ae5e9bb44be2004b5268666","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/845/527/b45c2130538b32d66b579c8f136f044e_original.PNG?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1467051754&auto=format&q=92&s=81b45c8c1ae5e9bb44be2004b5268666"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Let's bring a positive change.

This has been my passion for over 10 years to help families take away the anguish, sadness and emotional shock of all of the things that you need to do when that person either becomes very sick, injured, or passes away.  It's really difficult to get the information from an elderly parent or relative/friend when they don't think they are going to pass away. \"Oh no, nothing is going to happen like that,\" they say. So they don't want to face it and tell you anything. And when it's a tragic accident, they can't tell you. So I initially wrote a book and a workbook to start the process. I was shocked and saddened by one of the biggest hurdles facing families is when it comes time of crisis the family and friends don't have access to all of the details of that person's life puzzle needed to either complete or plan their final estate. Or to be able to continue on with their day-to-day workload that has been left for others to complete for them. It evolved and become a system even larger than that! Even for disasters, theft and crisis!It amazed me when we researched how our grand parents and generations before would keep and store important documents and ensure those that were left behind were secure. They would roll up all of the special forms, documents and information in a brown paper bag and stick in the rafters to keep it safe, just like in the movie, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\".So, I was determined to change this and create a functional yet innovative APP that would be safe but easy to have on your tablet or phone so you would access it when you need to. Hence, Your Backup Plan Mobile App!WHERE WE ARE AT:Here's where we are at with the Beta Version of Your Backup Plan App:/Fully functional Beta Version/1st Release Date scheduled for June 1st, 2015/Concentration with storage and security of all information/Our personal savings and countless hours invested/Now we need the money to take the YOUR BACKUP PLAN MOBILE APP from the beta version to the release date which includes the following costs:1- Development process $ 2,0002- Security consultation and integration $ 5,0003- Production of the final release to all of the various /     platforms $ 3,000/COME JOIN US AND HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES TO SPREAD THE WORD, AND GET YOUR BACKUP PLAN STARTED!","risks and challenges":"Risks and challenges/We have the team in place, and we're ready to go. We launched the Beta of YOUR BACKUP PLAN in 2012 to a great welcome from the community in a workbook and binder system. We've had the whole year to gather insight from our users — and build from our initial prototype./We've mapped out an astonishingly simple and helpful new version of YOUR BACKUP PLAN in a simple but extremely organized system in an APP version because IOS technology has evolved dramatically. Now Your Backup Plan code needs a framework built for all platforms to integrate for top of the line newest technology security. While concentrating on \"simple and easy to use\" and leaving \"nothing to chance\" we are currently building the next beta. Including a framework to encrypt your uploaded information, add it to a storage platform of your choice, and then the app will be able to access it with a push of a button after entering your secure

Cut: A young girl's reality inside a TN sex ring","info":{"description":"Princess Cut:/A young girl's reality inside a Tennessee sex ring/was created to /shed light on a dark,/but true,/story /about/sex trafficking. Our play follows a /young woman, \"Sarah\", as she relives memories of /first /being victimized by a /family member at the age of /5, of/then /being /introduced into what they called a /\"real estate ring\", and /of /later/learning/to live a double life as the psychological /trauma caught up with her. /Princess Cut/explores what sex trafficking really looks /like/here in the United States/and how /our /society/has failed/to recognize and /address this problem, leaving/little girls like \"Sarah\" to fall through the cracks. Princess Cut/is a play born from a need. The subject of sex trafficking,/especially /of children,/is one so repulsive many choose to /turn a blind eye. /This show /brings /the issue more clearly /to light. Done with the support of a /Greek-style chorus, the /narrative is tastefully executed with the aid of music and movement. The /audience is allowed to delve into the unnerving story of this one girl, from her /perspective, and is/unable to walk away without /seeing the issue more clearly. This show/allows opportunity for discussion. /A/question and answer session with /a panel of professionals follows each /performance, /giving/the audience /action /steps to fight sex trafficking within/their own communities. First performed in /Knoxville, TN, where this story took place, the show and panel /bluntly call/out /failing institutions and the language surrounding issues of abuse. In the months /following its premier, /repeat /performances were requested in Loudon, /Nashville,/and again in Knoxville, TN./In each location, /Princess Cut/forced its/audience to /have a good,/hard look at the /cities/in which they live.The New York International Fringe /Festival /is one of the largest multi-arts events in North America. It is an ideal platform for original and innovative theatre, and each year, FringeNYC accepts around two hundred applicants from the thousands it receives. Last month, we found out that Princess Cut was accepted to FringeNYC and now has the amazing opportunity to share Sarah's story with a larger audience. This show has already impacted the communities in which it was performed, and we are confident that it will continue to do so on a larger scale. Our company, Yellow Rose Productions, is passionate about producing theatre that provokes social change and promotes empathy in our audience. We /use theatre such as Princess Cut to deliver an /incredible narrative,/while simultaneously educating and raising awareness about /an important issue. Help us bring Sarah's story to FringeNYC. It is our hope that launching this Kickstarter will cover the costs of bringing our cast and crew to NYC for five performances of Princess Cut. After creating our budget and considering travel, food, lodging, promotion and production costs for our cast and crew of twelve, we realized that we needed to ask for financial help. We understand that there are countless projects that are worth funding, and we appreciate your consideration. Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign and for joining us in bringing Sarah's story to a larger audience. Building awareness and recognition is how we are committed to fighting sex trafficking. Danielle Roos/and /Kerri Koczen Yellow Rose Productions yellowroseproductions.org","risks and challenges":"The risks and challenges we face after becoming successfully funded are ones we are prepared to tackle. In the past, we have traveled with this show and we understand what challenges come with a new location. It can be difficult to put on a show in a theater venue we have not been to before. We also face the challenges of organizing and coordinating travel for twelve people. We are also solely responsible for promotion and drawing an audience in a city in which we have never produced. /This show was originally meant as a one night only production. Since its premier, we have tackled the challenges of producing the show in three different cities, and are fully confident in our ability to do it again on a larger scale./Learn about accountability

could recognise him. But he could play Tchaikovsky... Inspired by real-life events, AllthePigs Theatre Company discover the story behind 'The Piano Man' Andreas Grassl. Silent for four months, the world speculated about his identity - from the doctors who treated him, to the press who vilified him as a fraud, and to the countless people worldwide who claimed to know him./////AllthePigs Theatre Company are an award-winning collective who bring you theatre that is unpretentious, fun, relevant and pressure-free. As we like to put it, we make theatre for the audience. /Our Aims/In our quest to create a show that would have the legs to travel across the UK, we came across the extraordinary true story of The Piano Man - Andreas Grassl. The Piano Man's plight captured the world's imagination when it made international news in 2005, and we hope it will prove equally fascinating to audiences across the UK nearly ten years on. Our aim is to bring this story to life in an exciting, engaging and magical way for audiences not only in London, but in a variety of communities across the UK. Our tight-knit ensemble and flexible set design will enable us to perform in theatres, arts centres, abandoned buildings, and even on the odd beach!/About Us/AllthePigs have become known for working with young first-time writers and giving them their first experience of the industry; but when it came to The Piano Man we wanted to bring everything in-house and devise the show as a company. Our previous successes with devised work include two five-star rated shorts at The Vaults, but this will be our first full-length devised piece to date. We are asking for £1000 to go towards the Research and Development of this production. This sum will allow us to pay our actors for their time ahead of rehearsals, and will enable us to make this show the best it can possibly be. \"AllthePigs seem to pin theatre right back down to its roots and remind us why we go in the first place.\" The LondonistThis production is supported by:The New Diorama Emerging Companies Fund, The Vaults London, Exeter University Psychology Department, King's College London Trauma Department. 2014 PERFORMANCES: 11th - 15th November at The New Diorama. 2015 PERFORMANCES: Dates to be announced soon. A BIG BIG thank you from the Pigs.

After 45 attempts, they are wilting and exploding. They have rehearsed a thousand plays, and flit madly between them in order to appease the Master. They have jumped from Aristotelian narrative to Brechtian balderdash, searched inside Beckett’s bum and found nothing. In search of a new plane, they’ll dance – frenetic and frenzied – over a world full feta to find something better. Will they see daylight again? Come, humour their metatheatrical nutshell volcano./Nay, please help fund their volcano!We want to create a surreal, enrapturing set - the pixellated innards of the simulation game. Using glowing cubes, each representing one pixel of the characters' prison, we will surround them in their world. Large glowing white cubes will serve as chairs and pedestals. We'd like to minimise (ideally not use at all) stage lighting, to make the fictional world completely immersive and eliminate (when appropriate) the Stageness of the stage.In terms of costume, we also have ambitious plans. It seems only fitting that the game (set in a dysto-utopian some-sort-of-future where performance can be scored and quantified) has a suitably silly uniform. The three Tron-clad performers will glow and flash, with neon lining and... VELCRO. Props and costume will be fastened onto each character to facilitate the 'flit-flitting' - jumping from one character to another by the donning of military stripes, a stethoscope, a thermometer. Appropriately made-up with pixellated faces, our players will surely look the part. Base layers, velcro, neon lights, head torches, avatars, make-up...these all need funding!We also have the Grandmaester to think about. Maddened magician-cum-trickster, a many-faced wizard, Grandmaester Mandala has many guises. These are in the works (as is her surprise instrument!), and will no doubt be aptly spectacular and spectacularly silly - with your help!We have created a show which challenges audience, art, the act of acting and the action of direction. Scripting in swathes of improvisation, we've captured three competitors (actors, directors, participants in the Game) in genuine flux and dynamism. Exciting and slightly different every time, this show will definitely, defiantly, entertain to the max. Please help us make sure it does!","risks and challenges":"We're working very hard to make the most of every day available to us as a full cast - there aren't many days until the 15th (when we go up to Edinburgh), and we're only all together for half of them! But, alas and butt, we're on it like a car bonnet. We'll make it happen. /The difference YOUR donation can make is to render costume, prop and set construction less of an obstacle. We've already invested £150+ of personal funds into the project. The rest of the money will go towards creating a fantastic world - in the time that we have. We must also transport the entire set to Edinburgh from London.

Each season we will produce fully developed Shakespearean plays, and New Works inspired by those plays.  In dedicating ourselves to Shakespeare, we must also encourage the very profession he was immortalizing. Shakespeare is two things: a body of work, and a playwright.  We do not believe in rewriting Shakespeare, but we do believe in elevating the playwright. Shakespeare stole from Marlow, Marlow stole from Kyd, and all of them stole from popular history. We would like to give new playwrights that same opportunity for theft. Help us bring Shakespeare back to the playwrights. /The Commission Theater Company is dedicated to these ideals: -We will produce the works of William Shakespeare -We will work to honor and understand the verse, and in turn bring it clearly to the audience-We will encourage and elevate the playwright-We will give playwrights an avenue to create new work inspired by Shakespeare \t\t\ttheme’s, language, and stories./////Our First SeasonThe season will begin with a production of Love's Labour's Lost. A story about young love, smart men, and smarter women. Running August 12th - 16th at Piven Theater in Evanston, IL.\tNext up will be a staged reading of Henry IV, Part I. Join Prince Hal and Falstaff for a pint of ale at their favorite watering hole. A tavern style reading, with food, drink, and plenty of laughs. The Shakespeare Commission: An opportunity for theft. We'll ask a contemporary playwright what about Love's Labour's Lost or Henry 4 part 1 inspires them (a theme, character, verse, etc.), and ask them to take that spark and make a new work. We'll workshop it, and end in a staged reading.","risks and challenges":"Starting a new business, in today's economic market, is an enormous undertaking. Starting that business in the arts is even more of a challenge. We are very fortunate to be establishing our home in a city that takes great pride in its artists. That being said, there is strong competition within Chicago in terms of new, exciting theatre. It is no secret to say, new theater companies live and die within their first few years. They are finding their voices, testing the waters. But those vulnerable years are a time of necessary growth. The challenges we will face extend beyond this first season of plays. Primarily, in establishing a solid financial groundwork, managing those funds, and developing an audience base. /While all of us forming this company are artists, we are also entrepreneurs, and that is how we must view this venture. Every dollar we make is an investment into an aesthetic we have pledged to maintain. We will be called upon to use our backgrounds in managing, marketing, and producing as much as we will be called upon for acting, writing and directing. It is important to merge our artistic and small business owner sensibilities. /The four of us, have diverse backgrounds in arts and in business management. Much like our art, collaboration will help us survive the ever changing model that is a storefront theater./Learn about accountability on

by William Inge: An Inaugural Production","info":{"description":"Seat of the Pants Productions has been producing unique, high quality theater over the last 10 years in a variety of cities and spaces - everything ranging from a production of Cotton Patch Gospel starring students with Downs Syndrome, to a production of God of Carnage which raised funds to support anti-bullying initiatives in the public schools, to an entirely homegrown puppet opera of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Each initiative has been funded by Kickstarter, executed by many hard-working and dedicated folks, and well-received by the community.Now, the ensemble has an exciting opportunity to put down some roots, establish a permanent performance home, and expand the work we do.We've been invited by The Plain Local Community Center for the Arts to use their black box theater for a production this summer. This board of folks is creatively discovering ways for their state-of-the-art high school facility (which includes a medical clinic and a branch of the county library) to function as a community center for folks beyond the high school. Part of this plan involves offering high-caliber performances in several disciplines, and we've been asked to provide theatre. We've been invited to use the space and - if all goes well - establish an ongoing summer theatrical season in the space when it's not in use by the students.It's a tremendous and exciting opportunity, so we want to make sure that we knock it out of the park. And so, we're turning to Kickstarter to help underwrite a production of an American classic, PICNIC, by William Inge.///Costume Research by Inda Blatch-Geib///Set in Kansas in the early 50s, it's the story of a small community getting geared up to celebrate Labor Day with a town picnic. As summer comes to an end, the women (and men) in town find their humdrum routine upset by the presence of a drifter, who ignites passions in all sorts of directions, forcing folks to come to terms with love, desire, and sex.Monies already raised through previous ticket sales and a small grant are going toward publicity materials, lighting equipment, royalties, and ticketing costs.The funds we're requesting through Kickstarter will largely underwrite costumes, scenic construction, and properties. Now that we're in an actual theatrical space - as opposed to some of our guerrilla tactics on previous productions - we're trying to raise the production value a bit.Getting this production paid for up front will allow 100% of ticket revenue to go into a kitty for next year's production, ideally getting us stable footing in what we hope will be our new artistic home.We hope you'll consider supporting this project, sharing it with your friends, and then joining us for PICNIC, August 21-30, in Canton, Ohio! (Tickets at www.translationsart.com/picnic)  A simple $15 from everyone invited to donate would put us over the top! And remember - we have 30 days to make this happen - and we either raise ALL of it, or we get NONE of it!Thanks for reading and considering!","risks and challenges":"The biggest risks and challenges of the project involve this being our first time working in a new space on a tight timeframe. While we have estimates of what the set will cost to build, what sort of instrumentation we need to light the space, and how to amplify sound, none of us really knows./We're, of course, also building a new relationship with the school district and navigating what we can and can't do to the space, what resources are available to us, and just generally building trust./To prep for all possible snafus in these arenas, we've put a couple of things into place:/1) Our producer - this time around - is the drama teacher from the high school, someone who both knows and understands our needs, but also can be a good liaison with the school and represent their concerns./2) We've earmarked a slush fund of money that is not budgeted toward anything for if we suddenly run into unexpected costs./3) We are keeping a regular production log to note things that can be improved upon or done better in the future. The goal is to schedule a post mortem after the process to ensure that - if this does become our permanent home - this things can be smoothed over next time around./4) And quite simply, we've assembled a killer team of performers and designers who excel at new situations and contexts, and who will be able to navigate all this new stuff while still producing quality theatre./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"picnic-by-william-inge-an-inaugural-production","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"4511.0","backers_count":69,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":2024610,"background_color":null,"project_id":2024610,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1437417377,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/202/553/ebe0999b957114d07e30c7f3ffd4762c_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463741651&auto=format&q=92&s=17129ef516463b93da0d7922bc40b048","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/202/553/ebe0999b957114d07e30c7f3ffd4762c_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463741651&auto=format&q=92&s=17129ef516463b93da0d7922bc40b048"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"Seat of the Pants mounts our first show in a black box space that could become permanent;

The NYC premiere of David Greig’s Outlying Islands explores the themes of isolation, human freedom and climactic catastrophe - ideas which are vital to explore right now. Contributing to this campaign will help us to continue to achieve our goal, connecting communities across the world and engaging a whole new set of artists with our home team in Ireland. With your help we can continue to create connections as contemporary circumstances conspire to pull us further apart.In Greig's play, everything is on the edge. It is 1939 and the world trembles on the brink of war, the end of innocence. Two fresh-faced Cambridge ornithologists arrive on a remote island to conduct a survey of the birds for the government. At least, that is what Robert and his assistant John think they are doing.—————————————————————————————We ask what it means to live in a truly global world by creating productions that balance specific stories with wide reaching thematic impact. Sugarglass works under a shared ideal that the work it produces can offer an unexpected reflection of our contemporary society.Our productions are created through a uniquely collaborative process between director, designers and actors, making muscular work that can be impactful in our transient times.Sugarglass was founded in 2012 and has six core members, all of whom met at Trinity College Dublin. Company members have been selected for numerous awards and honours including the Irish Times Theatre Awards, The Next Stage at the Dublin Theatre Festival and the Jennifer Johnstone and Elizabeth Tuckerman Scholarships.“Sugarglass are divinely intervening in the conventional theatre-going experience.” - Musings in Intermissions","risks and challenges":"We are committed to a production that runs from March 30th - April 2nd.

But we NEED YOUR HELP!  This show is our biggest project to date, and we've got some of the best and brightest names in the Rhode Island performing arts working to make you laugh, sing, and question the existence of a higher power, including director Tyler Dobrowsky (Associate Artistic Director, Trinity Rep), actors Karen Carpenter and Casey Seymour Kim (resident artists, Gamm Theatre), and music director Esther Zabinski (Ocean State Theatre).

We believe that our work should be accessible to ANYONE who wants to be a part of it, and using the Gamm is a huge step in helping us make our work available to a wider audience. Whatever challenges we could face post-funding, we feel that, because of our history, experience, and demonstrated commitment to our artists and our audience, we are uniquely suited to overcome them.

Gunn and Starburst","info":{"description":" About Ray Gunn and StarburstRay Gunn and Starburst is a sci-fi comedy about two unlikely heroes finding their way in a galaxy ruled by a shockingly evil corporation called Darkleys. Tale as old as time, yes? Well, exactly, sci-fi/adventure stories are built on tropes and stereotypes, so how about taking all those tropes and mixing them up a bit. Let’s take away that dashing space pirate captain and replace him with a newly divorced forty-something, living in a wreck of a spaceship and completely unable to hold his own in a fight. On top of that he’s been dragged along with a rowdy teenage girl, who has heroism quite literally written through her DNA and her broken AI, made more of sarcasm than binary coding, and you have a recipe for disaster...uh, I mean, adventure. Ray may have absolutely no wish to become a hero but he hasn’t quite ruled out the idea of being a sidekick. Set in the year 2005 (as all the best sci-fi classics are), newly divorced, Raymond Gunn finds himself lying flat on his back in some seedy bar, on some seedy asteroid, in some seedy corner of galaxy, when suddenly Starburst and her AI, S.U.I.T (Survival Utility Intelligence Technology) burst into his life, with adventure, heroism and maybe a bit of blackmail on their minds. Cue the beginning of the rest of his life. Will Starburst break away from her dangerously, shady past? Will Ray ever manage to fix his space ship? Will the narrator actually be allowed to finish a story without irritating protagonists interrupting? Well you’ll have to give us some money to find out. Listen to our audio trailer below, featuring the marvellous voice acting talent of our awesome cast!/////And our exciting new series trailer://///The basic idea behind the series is to send up classic science-fiction, such as Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. I have always loved classic pulp sci-fi, the wonderfully over the top nature, the heroes ripping off their shirts, quirky robots, saving the day and doing some derring-do; all of that is full of comedic value. I also wanted to create something that felt pulpy and old school radio but with a modern twist, to take all of the classic tropes and mix them up a bit, and perhaps break the fourth wall into tiny pieces and dance on its grave. /The first episode was written as part of my final year project at University and I was lucky enough to be offered the chance to record that as a rough cut pilot. (link below) I went on to write a six episode series, and the recording of those episodes is what this Kickstarter will be funding, . //PILOT LINK /When the project is complete you will be able to find and download it for free on iTunes and our website (link to follow). You will also be able to purchase the CD from the website shop, as well as other Ray Gunn and Starburst merchandise./Cast and Crew/Open auditions were held, inviting people from all across the UK to take part in Ray Gunn and Starburst. From all those who sent in audition tapes the people you see below were the best of the best and we are all looking forward to working together. //////Rewards/The rewards are, of course, listed down the side of the page but here are just a few examples of what we will be offering. ////Standard logo badge//////Exclusive Kickstarter badge//////Ray Gunn and Starburst cotton tote-bag//////Exclusive Ray Gunn and Starburst Kickstarter shirt///The prints we are offering are by cast member and artist for Orang Utan Comics David Wynne, Roller Girls artist Gary Erskine and Doctor Who and Marvel Artist Mike Collins////The First Exclusive print by David Wynne///Costs// /Now, it does seem like a lot of money for a simple radio drama, but we wanted to create a really professional product and to thank everyone who got involved properly. //This chart gives a brief overview of the costs involved and why we need quite so much. ////Cost breakdown/// We are bringing all of the cast and crew to one location in Cardiff, Wales, to record. They are going to have to travel from all over the UK but it will mean that we are able to work in a completely professional environment, and the cast will be able to work together rather than recording separately and losing some of the drama in the scripts. We will spend four days working together, doing read throughs, recordings and pick ups all in that time. //Unfortunately, in the UK we have to pay a tax called Value Added Tax and that is costing us quite a lot.","risks and challenges":"The only risks to the project are any of the cast and crew getting ill, data corruption to the recordings and acts of God. /None of the rewards will be affected by this, save for the CD but it would still be made and sent out eventually./Learn about accountability on

It will require establishing a solid reputation with the work we produce in these early months and years. As we grow we will continue to develop a strategy to support ourselves through each season.

This campaign marks a crucial step toward our future. To continue bringing together great audiences and productions at the Coal Mine Theatre we need to ask for your support. In return we offer some great perks and this promise: We will always strive to rise you from your seats, thrill you with laughter, to challenge you with sights and sounds and reach you with inspired feeling.This $5,000 goal comes from our projected ticket sales crossed with a very modest, rock-and-roll indie theatre budget where talent is never sacrificed and quality is always worth more than a penny in the back pocket.

Our company exists to tell the stories of those whose voices are not heard often enough.  We want to celebrate the voices of women, and by funding Widow's Wedding Dress you will be helping OPIA on her maiden voyage.   /A theatre company in its infancy such as ours often has trouble meeting the monetary demands for a production. There is the cost of theatre space, advertising, box office deductions, costuming, and paying actors to name a few. Your generous donations will go towards helping OPIA stage Widow's Wedding Dress, but 25% of box office sales will be set aside in order to ensure the profit from this production will be used to create a sustainable budget for future productions and experiments in Canadian Feminist theatre.//Widow's Wedding Dress began as a 20-minute one woman show in 2015 when it was written as a culminating project at the University of Windsor.  While the four years of training in the BFA Acting program at Windsor prepares the actor to constantly create, this project was the first of its kind.//20 minutes.  By yourself.  No limitations.  //What to write about?  Where to begin? // I have always been interested in the stories of women whose voices seemed to be drowned out by the din of their often patriarchal cultures.  From 1950s housewives, to the history of sex trade, to cultural gender roles, I can watch just about any documentary or read any book that can tell me a story about a woman in her environment.  All I had to do was choose which story to tell./That story ended up being Widow's Wedding Dress; a tale about the last generation of Irish Traveller women who were truly nomadic.  Irish Travellers, or Irish Gypsies as they are sometimes referred to, were looked down upon by both the Irish government and their fellow citizens.  Often regarded as con artists and thieves, Ireland viewed them as a problem to be solved.  The Traveller culture including fighting, feuding, death, birth, and religion has been told almost exclusively from history's point of view as the story of men.  There is very little to be said about the women in the caravans and around the campfires.  Until now.","risks and challenges":"Just because a Kickstarter project is funded, it does not necessarily mean that the local community will support the production.  Many hours will need to go into advertising and promotion, with no real guarantee that an audience will come.  Should we face low ticket sales, an adjustment of the budget will occur to ensure that we will still have a fund to mount our next production.  Our goal is to become a sustainable feminist theatre company, not mount a single production and call it a day./Additionally, with the Canada Post strike looming, there may be a delay in delivery of items which require shipping in Canada.

My Head - A new mental health theatre project","info":{"description":"IN MY HEADA new play by Chris Mayo\"It's seen as a flaw, a weakness, people don't understand it, people are scared of what they can't see.\"Hurtling through twenty-two scenes, six actors play over forty characters in Chris Mayo's striking new play.A bold, loud, funny, angry, touching and honest portrayal of mental health in the modern world. IN MY HEAD is a part verbatim, part fictional exploration of those who struggle, those who help and those who fail to notice.We interviewed over 50 people both in person and via online surveys about their experiences of mental health conditions and have created a play that explores their stories as well as asks questions and challenges stigma.///In My Head - Proud Archivist - 9th - 14th November 2015///THE COMPANYCuckoo Bang is comprised of actor / comedian / playwright CHRIS MAYO and actor / musician / writer HOLLY MALLETT. Formed in 2013, our debut production 'Between Ten And Six' was performed at The Etc Theatre, Leicester Square Theatre and Brighton Fringe and was published by PlayDead Press. Our focus is on presenting new writing and collaborating with the best emerging actors, writers, directors, producers and creative talent in the UK. You can read more about the company and our previous work at www.cuckoobang.co.ukPLANS FOR THE SHOWOur Kickstarter campaign will cover the costs of our Autumn run at The Proud Archivist in Hackney, London from November 9th - 14th, however we have lots of plans for the show beyond that. We are making plans for future performances in London (Spring 2016), Brighton Fringe (May 2016), Edinburgh Festival (August 2016) and a potential tour of Arts Centres in Autumn 2016. Your donations will help us start the journey for the show and will be a vital part of a production we want to take to audiences across the UK.WHY ARE YOU PUTTING IT ON?We are hugely passionate about creating new work that excites, inspires and invites discussion. This is not just a 'Mental health play' but an exciting and passionate piece of new writing that raises important questions whilst still being accessible and entertaining.WHEN AND WHERE CAN WE SEE IT?The Proud Archivist, London. 9th - 14th November at 8pm. Tickets £10.We'll have ticket links and more info soon!THE COSTS We need your help to raise £3,000 to cover the basic costs of putting on a 6 night run of In My Head this Autumn. This works out as £300 -  Kickstarter's 10% fee£500 -  Venue hire£600 -   Rehearsal space£1200 - Actors performance fees£150 -  Director fee£75 -   Kickstarter rewards (Badges and posters)£175 -   Script publishing costsSTRETCH GOALSWe set our initial goal at £3000 to give us the best chance of raising the full amount and to cover the basic costs of putting on our show, the reality is there are lots of other costs involved which we hope we can raise beyond our initial target. These are called stretch goals and are as follows:STRETCH GOAL 1 - £3500If we can raise an additional £500, £300 will go to our actors who are currently working on a profit share basis. We want to pay a fair and guaranteed wage production which is only possible if we raise the extra money. £100 will cover our technicians basic expenses (they are currently working on a profit share only basis). £100 will go towards our set.STRETCH GOAL 2 - £4000An extra £200 to our actors fees, £100 towards our directors fee (who is currently working on basic expenses) and £200 towards our set costs (which will cost approx £1000)STRETCH GOAL 3 - £5000Extra fees for our actors, creative team and publicity.STRETCH GOAL 4 - £7500We can build our set and pay all our actors and creative team a decent fee for their involvement in the production.STRETCH GOAL 5 - £10000We're fit to burst with this stretch, but £10,000 covers all our costs. We can pay full fees to our actors and crew, build the full set we need which we will be able to take to all of our future venues. This will also mean we can start work on the costs involved for our Spring performances.We want you to know exactly where your money is going and we will keep you updated every step of the way!THANK YOU!We hope that gives you a good idea of the project. We're really excited to get In My Head off the ground and into theatres from this Autumn. Thank you so much for taking the time to check us out, anything you can spare is massively appreciated. If you can't donate please send the link to a friend or work colleague, tweet about us, share our info on Facebook, it all really helps and we literally couldn't do it without you!Huge thanks, we look

If the world is insane, it is not quite as mad as Dennis Kelly’s character.Together, they create a microcosmic, claustrophobic world in which big themes – sexual politics and ideas about fascism and decadence, power and responsibility – play themselves out in a pressure cooker environment.\"Dylan Moore","risks and challenges":"To be able to provide all the opportunities that we can in this first production we need to raise the minimum of £600.

I had heard about it, its macabre history, when I was a student studying theater, but never gave it much notice. For some reason, that winter, I became a fan. I began to assemble the team that became the THEATER OF DEATH company.   Once the actors and musicians fell into place, we produced our first production which was a bit rough but ended up being a great show and we sold out the run. Shortly thereafter, in the fall, we produced THEATER OF DEATH: THE ABSINTHE PLAYS which was another SELL OUT run of shows and refreshingly a bit more \"professional\" and clean in its execution (We took on Joel Nicholas as a Technical Director which was a big step!).   Our upcoming third production, THE TEQUILA PLAYS, will follow the \"formula\" of our past productions (short plays of horror and comedy with  live original music)  but with a stronger commitment to the goal of creating awesome theater. For instance:-We are always bringing in the most talented and spirited people we can find. The company keeps getting better and better!!-With the success of this fund raising campaign, we will be going into this next show with enough money to comfortably create without having to beg and borrow (though I'm sure we will do a little). Then, along with merch sales and tickets sales, we can move into the new year with a strong enough budget to create another production (I am already talking to the company about doing a series of HORRIFIC LOVE STORIES for Valentines Day).-We will be working with a professional PUBLICIST and we will extend our reputation to the further reaches of this community. Publicity Publicity Publicity!!!Ultimate goal of mine.  I would like to see the THEATER OF DEATH become the  premier Grand Guignol theater company in this part of the world, performing not only original plays (giving an opportunity for local writers and myself to develop plays in this genre), but also revisiting classics of horror and the macabre. Like the original Grand Guignol, I like to think that this theater with its  \"low brow sophistication\", will thrill the poor, the working class and the social elite of Northern New Mexico and the greater Southwest.","risks and challenges":"There are a million things that can go wrong with these shows. I think it just takes that singular vision to charge ahead no matter what the heck happens./   I think I have a strong vision and i think i inspire people. People get on board./   The 1st production may have been the hardest. I had to CONVINCE people of this idea. Now we've seen it succeed and people \"get it\"./Learn about accountability on

TES a success at The Edinburgh Fringe Fest","info":{"description":"I am looking to bring what I consider to be socially relevant, conscious, engaging, quality, and important stories to as large an audience base as I possibly can, firstly through theatre and then hopefully in the future through TV and film./Critical to this aim is the success of 'TES - Tess of the D'Urbervilles Re-imagined' at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival.TES is a show that I have developed over a number of years. I toured the show last year at Canadian Fringe Festivals where it was a critical and box office success:\"An Orwellian portrayal of Britain's rotting underbelly that slices like a rusty razor\" Victoria Times Colonist\"Bring a pocket full of tissues before you embark on this emotional journey and prepare to leave stunned and inspired by the power of Larkin’s spoken word.\"/Edmonton Sun \"Tragic tale with humour, poetry, wordplay and enough pathos to leave the audience shaken. One of the best shows at the fringe, no doubt\" Vue Magazine  ***** /This show is the pinnacle of my artistic career so far and I have high hopes for its exposure in the UK./////I have been evolving my practice over a number of years, mainly in North America, and I have developed a significant profile and following on the other side of the Atlantic.  /In the UK I am known chiefly as a promoter, a host, and an occasional poet having ploughed much time and energy into developing the Hammer & Tongue poetry slam and touring network which I created in 2003, seeing through the transition from a one-off gig to a larger network of events that lead to a National Poetry Slam Final at The Royal Albert Hall./////Opportunities to expose my own artistic talents, have been extremely limited in my country of domicile, whose spoken word scene I have served well for decades, and it feels very much as if it is high time that I announce my presence and establish my reputation as an artist in the UK.Only success at The Edinburgh Fringe Festival will achieve this aim.I am in a great position to do this with TES if I can utilize substantial resources to stand out from the crowd at Edinburgh.I have been accepted into one of the best venues - The Underbelly.  I will be performing TES every day in 'The Wee Coo' at 13:15.  This means that I will be able to perform the show in a decent theatrical environment with a good technical set up, which is extremely important to the show given that it has an audio-scape that was developed with Olivier-Award nominated West End sound designer Chris Full.The show was written for and about the UK where there is a huge amount of interest in literary heritage and I believe that given a professional job on the promotional front that it will be an intriguing show to a great number of people.TES follows the plot of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel very closely re-inventing the main character as a teenage hoodie from a council estate who is found to be descended from a famous Romantic poet.  He suffers a similar tragic fate to that of the original Tess./Hardy's original examines philosophical or historical determinism, and the apparent impossibility of social mobility in Victorian Britain.  Everything that can go wrong for the innocent rural beauty Tess does go wrong as we witness her 'progress' from pastoral pageantry to slave-like labour in finger-bleeding mechanised farming.  Intertwined is, what is, in my opinion, one of the most beautifully written love stories of all time.  Hardy was extremely conscious of the effect of one period of history passing to another./In re-imagining the story in post-industrial Britain I have given myself the opportunity to comment or ask questions about the current political situation in the UK and I have embedded real-life stories and poetic reactions into the plot./As soon as it was conceived in 2012 I knew what I wanted it to be: a dramatic reinvention of a novel, written with a cinematic eye, that draws parallels between pre and post industrial ages, personifying injustice in a protagonist drowning in pathos. /In creating the piece I followed the original closely, finding modern-day equivalents, where Hardy paints pastoral landscapes strewn with seeds I imagined analogous symbolism to point towards the inevitable with an urban/techno soundscape./After devising a pure storytelling version of the show with the guidance of New York storyteller Martin Dockery utilising my performative instincts that have come about from many years of being noticed in bustling club environments and winning over audiences with stand up poetry I produced a    vibrant visceral script by devising the story exclusively orally with no written script.//////In early 2014 I was awarded a residency with Underconstruction Theatre and had the benefit of working with the extremely talented dramaturge Lizzy McBain.  She gave me much more direction and had a great impact on the piece with vital theatrical developments to characterization and blocking.  /////I worked with the amazing Chris Full to create the immersive 3D audio-scape. In doing this I was able to realise the initial vision and fully realise the aim of creating a unique and professional theatre show.The residency also involved me writing a blog about the progress of the development:http://scratch.underconstructiontheatre.com/theatre-scratch-residency-day-1/and a video trailer being produced for the show by Ricky Tart of Tricky Arts:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYiWT-f22QI/I then toured the show for three months in Canada.  Canada was expensive to get to and to tour around so there was no significant financial gain but it gave me the opportunity for editing and polishing through performing the piece every other night in front of audiences.It also resulted in fantastic press.  At the Edmonton International Fringe Festival (the biggest in North America) it got the best overall star ratings of any show./////http://www.edmontonsun.com/2014/08/17/fringe-review-tesI have never been in a better position to impress the theatrical world.  So much work has gone into this piece of spoken word theatre. I believe I have created, with help from others, a unique piece of art.  If I have the opportunity to invite people into this world that I have created it will lead on I'm sure.I have ambitions to take this on and create a film or TV mini-series version of TES.  Edinburgh is the best place to start conversations about such potential collaboration.This is  only likely to occur if I have the resources to have professional PR and mount a thorough publicity campaign.With no tickets sold Edinburgh could set me back somewhere in the region of £10K:Venue Guarantee: £2251.01/Venue Programme Entries: £600.00/Fringe Registration Fee: £393.60/Professional PR: £3500.00/Print / Distribution: £1500.00/Accomodation: £1400.00/Subsistence: £400.00Total: £10044.00I would like to go to Edinburgh focused on performing the show to the best of my ability and networking far and wide.  The success of this kickstarter campaign will enable me to do just that.","risks and challenges":"I’m going no matter what.

Supported by the generosity of others, the local council and other foundations and trusts, we provide people ages 3 to 93 with fun, community-orientated development and vocational training. National Theatre Connections is a project for which we receive no external funding. The National Theatre kindly granted us a bursary to avoid the cost of taking part in the project, but no other monies are forthcoming.While some children do pay a fee to join the project (which covers the cost of a director, any assistants and rehearsal rooms), others pay a much reduced concession rate. Many of our students however, are awarded a scholarship to attend the rehearsals, for reasons ranging from their families financial situation to being young carers and deserving the opportunity to go out and do something they love.We believe in the transformative nature of the arts; we have seen these students grow under our director by developing essential skills including increased empathy, personal presence and public speaking. NT CONNECTIONS: WHAT IS THAT?!National Theatre Connections is an initiative run by the National Theatre to help young theatre makers (13 - 18) experience a professional theatre environment.The project has 3 main stages:1. Development! In October 2015, a group of 19 young students began developing a play; I'm Spilling my Heart Out Here by Stacey Gregg. This has involved collaborative rehearsals with their director Florence O'Mahony, learning script, creating characters and much more!2. Home Performances! At the end of February 2016, this talented bunch of students will perform this 45 minute play three times. This can be in any performance venue, and MTA have been lucky to secure the Tramshed in Woolwich and the MCT at Alleyn's School-  but venues like this don't come cheap, despite the very kind rates offered to us as a local charity.At one of these performances an NT Connections director will watch, and give feedback from the performance.3. Greenwich Theatre Performance! On 20th March 2016, MTA students will 'tread the boards' at Greenwich Theatre, performing before another NT Connections representative and a public audience.

Performances will run May 13th-28th at St. Paul’s Theater in Brooklyn. / Knock, knock, knock. Who's there?Founded in 2011, Old Hat is a Brooklyn-based classical theater company comprised of actors, academics, designers, musicians, and writers. Our diverse artistic backgrounds are reflected in our work. We are dedicated to producing Shakespeare and other classical works in fresh, imaginative ways while remaining faithful to the original texts, whose richness makes them a limitless source of inspiration. /Our past projects include Hamlet, Twelfth Night, and original adaptations of Chekhov short stories. We have staged productions in interesting spaces around Brooklyn, from an old public bathhouse in Gowanus to a parlor in a 19th-century townhouse on Prospect Park West. Macbeth will go up in the recently restored St. Paul’s Theater in Williamsburg.  We are excited for the opportunity to expand our audience and community.  / By the pricking of my thumbs...Our Macbeth production is set in a surreal landscape inspired by the bleak and treacherous no-man's-land of World War I. We explore the loneliness and distorted morality that emerge from a culture of violence; how war and murder may blur and deform one's very sense of self.  These themes in the play are always resonant and timely, as war and loss are always present in the world. /\"Cruel are the times when we are traitors / And do not know ourselves ...But float upon a violent sea / Each way and move.\" / Thou wouldst be great!This project is about more than a single production. It marks some important firsts for Old Hat, which will help us become a sustained positive artistic force in the Brooklyn community and beyond. This will be our first three-week performance run, which will increase our visibility and introduce us to a larger, more diverse audience.  The additional performances will increase our income, enabling us to move quickly into our next production. For the first time, we will engage the local community through subsidized tickets for students, Q & As with the cast and crew, and open rehearsal workshops.  These programs will be developed and augmented over future productions and with our first student workshops coming this summer. We feel it is vital for young people to discover and stay connected to the wisdom of great literature and for all people to have access to affordable classical theater. But to do all this, we need your help!/We have secured a space, dates, a tremendous cast, and production is under way. There are many areas that need your support.  Your gift of any sum can make a tremendous difference: / /$50 subsidizes three tickets for Brooklyn students/$100 prints our programs or underwrites our sound equipment/$250 rents a week’s worth of rehearsal space/$500 funds our educational programming/$1,000 builds our set or costumes our company /Open locks, whoever knocks!Your contribution will bring Macbeth to life, and it will help to make our greater mission sustainable. The opportunity here is for you to help Old Hat Theatre Company grow, to be a part of a force for cultural good. We are a group who wants to do classical theater because it’s good for the world. It’s good to confront political ideas and illuminate profound psychology and poetry, to promote analysis and literacy and debate, to invite everyone to recognize themselves in these great and timeless stories. We ask you to support us now, so we can take a leap forward with this Macbeth production and do our work more often, in more places, for more people. Thank you for your contribution! ","risks and challenges":"Producing theater in NYC – and getting people to notice – is always a challenge, but we have the advantages of experience and a supportive community. With your funding and support, we're confident that our efforts to bring the production to the Brooklyn community and beyond will be successful./Learn about accountability on

FOR MEASURE: an all-female adaptation","info":{"description":"The eccentric Duke of Vienna leaves Lord Angelo in charge of his city while he disguises himself as a friar. Lord Angelo uses this as an opportunity to rid the city of the one thing everybody hates: Sex. / /In this ninety-minute adaptation of the classic Shakespeare play, a cast of ten women asks the question: What even is virginity anyway?ABOUT THE PRODUCTIONIn Elizabethan times, it was illegal for women to be on stage. Consequently, most plays consisted of a male-centric story line and the token female characters were played by men dressed as women. Since then, the English-speaking world (and many other worlds) has continued the tradition of writing plays about men featuring mostly male casts. In 2016, I have made the directorial decision for it to be illegal for men to be on my Elizabethan stage. My name is Lizz (that's where the wordplay for \"Elizabethan\" comes in!) and I humbly ask you to consider donating to help me make up for hundreds of years of lack of female representation on stage.WHY MEASURE FOR MEASUREWhile the Duke is \"away,\" Lord Angelo tries to shut down all of the brothels and behead anyone caught fornicating out of wedlock, no matter how consensual it is. Claudio has been discovered to have knocked up his girlfriend and is sent to prison. His sister, who is studying to become a nun, tries to appeal to Angelo like a rational human being and in turn he will only agree to let her brother free if she yields her virginity to him.Basically, the whole play is about men getting upset over what women can or cannot do with their own bodies. Performing it with an all-female cast dressed like men? Hilarious.ABOUT THE NYC WOMEN'S WORK FESTIVALPresented by WEBroadway, The Women's Work Festival is a week-long showcase of full-length plays and musicals written/adapted by women. We will be taking over the Playroom Theater in midtown from June 22nd-26th (Measure for Measure will be on June 24th and 25th). On average, the divide between writers on Broadway (including book writers, composers, and lyricists) is around 90% male, 10% female./On average, the people purchasing tickets to Broadway shows are around 70% female. If women are buying the tickets, why aren’t we letting women tell the stories?For more information on the Women's Work Festival and WEBroadway please visit webroadway.org (which is also where you can buy your tickets!)We have a wonderful cast of 10 women who deserve proper rehearsal space, costumes, and props. Theater is expensive. I humbly ask that you consider donating towards this passion project of ours.And let us make you laugh!","risks and challenges":"I cannot stress enough how expensive theater is. If we rehearse 3 hours a day for three weeks in an actual rehearsal studio instead of outside in the rain it will cost about $1000.

from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is a project already more than two years in the making with a live production being the next big step in its creation. In order to make that happen, we need your help. Tickets are free for this October production--that's right: FREE. Your donation to this fund helps us to cover the production costs to create a professional, enjoyable experience at no cost to our audience. Consider your gift as the cost of your ticket. Whether you attend a performance or not (and we hope you do!), you are affording many community members the opportunity to see a live theatre production when they may not have the opportunity to do so with skyrocketing ticket prices on many professional shows. Anything you are able to donate will help us reach our goal. We cannot thank you enough for supporting our endeavors and live theatre in general. Please visit our website or check us out on Twitter @NovaLightArt for more information about this project and other upcoming public works. THANK YOU for your help.","risks and challenges":"Theatre productions can run into many issues in their creation stage, particularly with a new, untested play. Having successfully produced two well received original plays in the past, our director Chelsea Anderson is very familiar with the pitfalls of getting a production on its feet. This time around, we have a professional, creative group of designers who are used to the challenges of a small budget and limited resources. We have a cast of actors who can rise to any occasion and make reading the telephone book compelling.

Rules: Sex, Lies & Serial Killers","info":{"description":"This August Team Sprocket will be leaving these London shores in order to break our Edinburgh Fringe seal with devilishly funny new play THE RULES: SEX, LIES & SERIAL KILLERS - and we need your help to get us there!Who we are: Lila Whelan - writer, Jez Pike - director, Isabel Dixon - associate producer, Suneeda Maruthiyil - designer, Alex Pearson - stage managerCast: Catherine Nix-Collins, Neil Chinneck, Ben Higgins and Lila Whelan./////Glad you asked! Toying with our current gleeful obsession with TV anti-heroes (House of Cards, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Wire), THE RULES is a deliciously deviant imagining of what serial killers get up to behind closed doors. It's a dark, sexy and brilliantly funny play that's so original it quite possibly creates its own genre; the blackly comic serial-killer romance. Full of quick-fire dialogue, believably-grounded characters and mischievous twists, THE RULES manages to be both a devilish roller-coaster ride and a truthful rendering of love in the most unlikely places./////Psychopaths Jay, Mel and Steven meet up once in a while to unwind, hang up their guns and let their hair down - within a few guidelines established for their protection and anonymity of course.//But when the innocent Teresa enters their world, loyalties are tested and the rules start to get broken, one by one. And when serial killers break the rules, the consequences can be a little...messy.//But hey, rules are made to be broken, aren't they?//////First up the show is genuinely awesome and you're going to love it. /Secondly because Sprocket makes thrillingly original theatre that moves, haunts, challenges and - most importantly - entertains. We say boo to the boring and the pretentious and the over-reliance on celebrity-fronted stuffy old plays that colours London’s West End. ///Thirdly, we are on a mission to provide more roles for women and so all of our productions consist of at least 50% women (on and off stage)./Fourthly, in every production we engage and support new and emerging talent./Finally, Edinburgh is just the start of our journey with The Rules - with your help we can make it a huge success up north and then the world's our oyster!//////The money you'll donate will go lovingly towards hiring a rehearsal space for 4 weeks (£600), printing flyers and posters (£200), buying props and costumes (£250), creating the set (£350), transporting all of that lot (£50), along with our eight-person team (£550), up to Edinburgh!**and maybe back down again if they're well behaved./////Okey doke! On Wednesday 15 July we'd like to invite everyone who's donated £10 or more to attend THE RULES launch party Pub Quiz night with our cast and crew. //Where: the Reliance Pub, 336 Old St, London EC1V 9DR www.thereliancepub.co.uk///When: 15 July, doors open at 6.15pm ///Tickets can be bought by pledging on our Kickstarter/There'll be fantastic raffle prizes up for grabs, a pub quiz with special serial-killer flavoured round with a tip-top secret prize (it is GOOD!) and generally lots of rowdy fun to send us off on our way.Prizes to be announced - keep checking back!/////We've been working tirelessly on this show since 2013, from it's earliest infancy with a showcase at the Old Red Lion Theatre in 2013 right through to a series of workshops and rehearsed readings in 2014 and 2015.2013

Frida Kahlo of Penge West","info":{"description":"Right.  Chris Larner (that's me) has been, as actor, songwriter, director and writer, creating theatre for many years.  As an actor I was the idiot Clingfilm in London's Burning, if that's of any interest.  I wrote songs for, and appeared on stage with comedy legends The Right Size.  Two musicals (both written with Mark Stevens) The Translucent Frogs of Quuup and On The Island of Aars, won awards and plaudits at Edinburgh.  My one-man show An Instinct for Kindness, which tells the story of my accompanying my ex-wife Allyson, to Dignitas in Switzerland, has won awards and acclaim both Nationally and internationally.  All of this: reviews etc and my full CV on www.chrislarner.comThe Frida Kahlo of Penge West, is a two-women play by me.  It will rehearse in June this year, and play at the Rosemary Branch theatre, Islington, http://www.rosemarybranch.co.uk for the first two weeks of July.  Here's the blurb;A two-woman play about one woman's struggle to stage a one-woman play about Frida Kahlo, with two women in it..When quiet, retiring Zoe agrees to let an old university chum sleep on her sofa for a couple of nights, little does she imagine how much her life will be blown apart.   Vain, driven, narcissistic Ruth is an unemployed actor and REALLY CROSS with it.  She decides to do a play of her own, and drags Zoe with her, kicking and screaming, with hysterical results.  Wickedly funny, caustic and absurd, this is about two women driving each other to the extremes.  The Odd Couple meets Resevoir Dogs, but with big laughsWelcome to the world of madcap passion, betrayal, political correctness, wigs and bad, bad Mexican accents.Credits; Director: me.  Producer: Kat Portman.  Cast: Cecily Nash and Laura Kirman, two VERY funny young actresses.  Design: Nina Patel-Grainger. Lighting design: Celia Dugua.  Costume: Natalie Pryce.This is gonna be very, very funny, although Frida Kahlo fans may want to look away, now.  Anyone wants to pledge a hundred quid or over, gets to see the script to see how I've made sense of all that.  We can just about stage this show - with everyone getting a pittance and not eating - for about eight grand.  It'll be tight for that.  The team on design, costume, lighting, etc are all young, highly talented, enthusiastic women at the starts of their careers.  Marketing and publicity are vital and have to be paid for, as does the set and costumes.  The aim is to tour the show in the Spring of 2015, and to that end we need this initial production to be as sharp as possible and get good reviews. Eight grand covers the basic costs.  Twelve grand makes it much easier and we can eat.  Fifteen grand and everyone gets paid properly.  The venue seats sixty and we're on for twelve performances.  If we sell out the finances ease somewhat, but it's still a squeezeI've applied for Arts' Council funding but it's anyone's guess.  And even if the Arts council cough up, it will not, in any case, cover the full cost of the production, and we won't know until 9th July: day one of rehearsals.  This Kickstarter money of three grand will pay for set, costumes, and the wages of a stage manager to run the show.  It's only a start of the money needed, but there's a full-on, outrageous show at the end of it.  Anything else you care to know, email me: chris@chrislarner.orangehome.co.uk","risks and challenges":"Lack of funds means corner-cutting, delays and frustrations on all manner of things; publicity, set-build, actors having to temp instead of rehearsing, bailiffs at the door, having to rehearse in a cupboard somewhere.  Kat Portman's experience as a producer, and mine as a director and writer ought to be able to steer this production through the choppiest of waters, and see it through to a successful tour, next year.  But money lubricates the whole business../Any work of theatre is a risk.  We have a great script, a team talented and more enthusiasm than a spaniel in Springtime.  BUT - people may hate it, come opening night.  I'd be surprised if that were the case, but they may.  It's a risk I and the whole team are willing to take/Learn about accountability on

You are one of the select individuals clicking on something with sentences and paragraphs instead of a cat gif. This is just as awesome. We promise.Before you leave, we'll answer the questions that you’re DYING to know before you take that BuzzFeed quiz.Who are we?We are Battalion Theatre Company. Born in early 2014, we are a group of young actors, directors, producers and artists who came together to follow the fun to the truth of the human condition. The founding members are: Kullan Edberg, Dan Gonon, Gadi Rubin, and Gerrit Thurston. In April 2014, we put on The Understudy by Theresa Rebeck at HorseTrade's Under St. Marks Theatre. In May, we were asked to remount the production at The Kraine Theater. After starting a residency with HorseTrade in the summer, we put on Adam Bock's The Drunken City in September. Through November and December we workshopped and produced a reading of a new play, When I Started Dating Men, by Ryan Trout. In March 2015, we are putting on The Tutors by Erica Lipez; directed and produced by Gadi Rubin.What's different this time?The PlotNew York. 2007.3 years after the social network to rule all social networks was founded. Three recent college grads find themselves stuck when forced to take on day jobs as tutors and online essay editors in hopes of fueling their own social networking startup. With a student blackmailing two of them and work invading the subconscious of the third, these three friends might just be in over their heads.The CollaboratorsThrough our first two productions, we have joined forces with set designers, lighting designers, casting directors, stage managers, and more who believe in our work and want to help us produce amazing productions. Hooray for collaboration.MoneyMoney? Oh yeah. Our first show was done completely out of pocket and we pretty much entirely financed our second show as well. We like to say that we \"paid a lot of money to do what we love.\" This time we want to do things a little differently and give audience members SO MUCH MORE than what they'd expect in terms of production value. Perhaps more importantly, a major priority for us is to pay everyone involved a little something - getting paid for what you love to do is amazing. (It's the least we can do for those who are locked in a theater for multiple days straight with us, as amicable as we are.)Umm, okay, what do you need the money for?/Royalties/Set Design/Rehearsal Space/Artists/We are a young group but we are committed to paying all of our artists for their time, hard work, and brilliant skills. We believe in investing in the people we are so lucky to create with-people who deserve to tell their families and friends that they were actually paid to do what they love, even if it wasn't much.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute financially at this time, we still love you and would be thrilled if instead you could:/Come and see the show!

Kill a Machine","info":{"description":"To/Kill a Machine is a new full length play written by Welsh writer Catrin Fflur/Huws. It is an empowering and heartbreaking story of a man guilty only of knowledge,/homosexuality and refusing to live a lie who was turned into a hero, vilified/for his sexuality and suicide and resurrected to hero after his death./“Turing’s life work was/the development of some of the fundamental ideas of information and computation, which underlie the subject.  Plausible and/technically-accurate depictions of science on stage are extremely rare, but/they are extremely helpful to bring the subject to life in the minds of/students and their parents.  Moreover, anchoring a technical subject into/the web of human experience and history (especially British history) gives a/far more healthy and holistic view of a subject that can be seen as very narrow/and geeky.” Simon Peyton Jones, Computing at School/“both/play and production are highly impressive, boding well for the future of what/appears to be an ambitious new company” Othniel/Smith/“It is well known among/the computer science community that Turing’s influence is much deeper than his/time spent at Bletchley Park but these aspects are rarely seen beyond that one,/albeit, fabulous story.  It is/particularly helpful to place such pioneers in the context of a real human/story that our children can, hopefully, identify with.  I am sure that this play will be relevant and/attractive for many school teachers, pupils, undergraduates and the like.  Decent portrayals of science, maths and/computing are rare in our theatres and such work seeking to heighten awareness/of the work and impact of Alan Turing is to be welcomed.” Simon Humphreys,/National Coordinator Computing at SchoolWhat is the play about?/////The play examines the life of/war-time code breaker Alan Turing examining his pioneering work considering/whether a machine could think. The play asks the question what then is the/difference between a human and a machine? And if a human is prevented from/thinking, does he then become a machine?To Kill a Machine does not shy away/from the truth of his story - his homosexuality, the injustice of his/conviction,  the brutality of the/chemical castration, his treatment by the government following his conviction/through to his only very recent pardon. Nor does it shy away from the/complexity of Alan Turing’s brilliant mathematical mind and instead embraces/his work about machines and places it at the heart of the play.You can visit our website here. Or/like us on facebook and follow us on twitter \"The tension is mounting here on To Build a Machine. Can the/interrogator crack the code? Will the contestants keep their secrets? It's time/to play on. It's time to play - Imitation\". To Kill a Machine, Catrin/Fflur HuwsSo/that is the play, what else does the project involve?Not only do we want to tour the play/but we are committed to promoting the life, work and legacy of Alan Turing/beyond the play. We want to share the amazing stories of Alan Turing – throughout/his life, and also the impact that his work continues to make to the day. His/achievements during the war were incredible but there is so much more and we/want to share that – through workshops, talks, debates, on-line discussions,/hackathons, tweetups, blogs, articles. Basically anywhere there is a platform/to talk about we’ll be there – talking about our play and talking about Alan/Turing. \"'Dip the apple in the brew let the sleeping death seep through' Half of/it poisoned. The other half is not. Snow White will eat the poisoned apple of/course\" To Kill a Machine, Catrin Fflur HuwsThe story so farIn 2012 Catrin Fflur Huws went/to visit Bletchley Park with her computer scientist husband Jim Finnis and/looked around an exhibition of Alan Turing – his life and work at Bletchley Park./She had been selected for the Sherman Cymru and Aberystwyth Arts Centre Spread/the Word project and had to write a short play. She chose to write a short play/about Alan Turing. She was particularly inspired by/the story of a man being elevated to a hero, vilified and then resurrected to a/hero after his death, she then read his article,  Computing Machinery and Intelligence (Turing,/A.M. (1950)) in which Turing begins by asking two key questions: what is the/difference between a man and a woman and what is the difference between a man/and a machine. In addition to that Catrin is a law lecturer at Aberystwyth/University which adds yet another dimension of her interest in performance and/law and using real trial transcripts to create work – the court scene in the/play is based on a real transcript of a trial for Gross Indecency. Her short play was selected for/a reading – but that wasn’t enough. She decided she needed to write the play/into a full length play and she sought out a producer which is when/Scriptography productions became involved. //////It is no accident that we are/called Scriptography – To Kill a Machine was the start of the company and it/will always be at the heart of the company and in respect of Alan Turing and/the many ways he changed our lives we named the company Scriptography. Aberystwyth University’s/Computer Science department were holding a centenary event celebrating the/birth of Alan Turing – they invited us to perform a reading of the play as part/of it. Since that first reading they have remained committed to the project and/BCS Mid Wales paid for the very first programme which included articles about/Turing’s work – mathematical patterns in nature, artificial intelligence and/the Turing Machine.  The play was produced as a pilot/– in 8 days because that was all we could afford to do. Angharad Lee joined the/company as director, actors Gwydion Rhys – who had the overwhelming task of/bringing to life Alan Turing in just 8 days, alongside Gareth Bale, Ceri/Murphy, Stephen Marzella and Thomas Middler who joined as our male ensemble. It/seemed an impossible task – to mount a complex play featuring historical scenes/alongside a game show! But not only did we do it – Rupert built an incredible/set and we created a soundscape too. It was first performed at/Aberystwyth Arts Centre who also provided rehearsal space.  We were also invited to perform it at Sherman Cymru Foyer. In looking for possible/other places to perform we approached Sybil Crouch at Taliesin Arts Centre –/though they didn’t have space she put us in touch with Arnold Beckman in/Swansea University’s Computer Science department. Arnold was arranging a/science cafe centenary event and invited the play to be performed at it. /////It was that performance to an/audience of computer scientists and ardent Alan Turing fans where we realised the/potential of this play by Catrin Fflur Huws and with  Angharad /as director.  Not only a great/play but a play that computer scientists would embrace, a play that would/instigate discussions, a play that would do justice to the legacy of Alan/Turing. A play that told the story of Alan Turing the way he would have wanted/it to be told. Here are a few reviews of that/early pilot production/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/play-about-enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-to-coincide-with-centenary-celebrationsReview by Amanda Clare, Lecturer in Computer Science,/Aberystwyth University/http://amanda-clare.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/review-to-kill-machine.htmlReview by Othniel Smith/http://blakeson.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/to-kill-machine.html \"My feelings, my love was blind. They could discern no/difference between a love for a man and love for a woman.\" To Kill a Machine, Catrin Fflur HuwsWhat do we want to do next?In the last few years we have/continued to develop the play with Catrin, though it was already a unique,/innovative play we supported her in developing it, adding a few new scenes to/the biographical scenes including a great scene about Alan Turing signing up/for the National Guard and integrating fully the bizarre game show into the/play.Not only that but Scriptography/Productions has been producing more plays, creating more work, supporting other/writers and building itself into the company that could do justice to this/great project.In 8 days and with minimal/budget we achieved something incredible – imagine what we could do with more/rehearsal time, a decent production budget and a production and marketing staff/to support it. We already have a tour of Wales/booked including Arad Goch in Aberystwyth, Theatr Brycheiniog, Torch Theatre,/Taliesin Arts Centre, Blackwood Miners Institute, The Miners and Theatr Hafren.In addition we will be taking/the play to Arcola Theatre in London and then later in the year we will be/presenting the play at Edinburgh fringe festival where we will be able to invite venue programmers from around the UK and festivals throughout/the world. With your support we can get the/play out there, we can get reviews, we can get more tours booked./////This is the story of a play, a/writer and a company being brought to life and we are especially proud that it/with such an incredible story as that of Alan Turing, the man, the work, the/legacy. A man whose life was cut tragically short but whose legacy continues to/impact throughout the world.

Pressure on arts funding is immense at the moment and so we have diversified the way we are raising the money as much as we can to create a sustainable financial framework for the project. However if we can raise at least £8,000 here then we can match fund that from other sources. The money raised/will allow us to rehearse, and produce the project, it will cover the costs of/the initial tour. This will get the project seen and establish a reputation/which will then allow is to sustain the project to keep touring it with all/costs covered by fees paid. Basically this campaign will launch it and beyond/that its future will be for as long as there is an audience for it and so/theatre venues who want to book it.","risks and challenges":"Creating a great arts project, especially a new play is always faced with challenges – achieving our funding goal is the main one. Without support and funding from a number of sources the project can’t happen but we have put a great strategy in place, we are keeping costs low, realistic but low and we are working on a number of options to ensure that our financial requirements are met./We are a new company so we’ve ensured we have the right expertise to get us through. We have also sought collaborations and partnerships – Arad Goch is a co-producer who will provide rehearsal support, technical advice, marketing advice – basically anything we need to know they can help us with. In addition we are an associate company at Aberystwyth Arts Centre and can call on their vast experience of all aspects of arts production if we need it. /We are a new company though and with those risks come some advantages – we are going to be innovative, we are going to be positive, we are going to take risks, we are going to approach things in a new way because we think taking risks and facing challenges is good. /We think risks and challenges can lead to creative approaches, can lead to innovative breakthroughs./After all Alan Turing took risks and he faced challenges and we want to be inspired to do things the way he did./Learn about accountability on

of June","info":{"description":"About the project'Rose of June' is being performed at The Unity Theatre, Liverpool in September 2014. It is supported by the of the Making Art scheme, but we are in need of a little bit of funding to make this production awesome!  Roses of June is based on the 5 stages of grief drawn from the company’s experiences and the Kübler-Ross model.Using our own experiences and through the study of these stages we hope to create a beautiful and reflective piece of theatre. We are a company of three actors and one director and are all emerging artists trying to find our way in the wonderful world of theatre!To present these motifs the narrative follows the central character Sam and how he copes with loss and the effects on others around him, specifically the two other characters Emily and Daniel.//We want to explore a different approach to theatre making inspired by the creative processes of Mike Leigh. Although Leigh works with a script, he does not share this with his actors until later in the process. Instead, in the rehearsal room, he builds characters, events and the world in which they inhabit through experiments and improvisational exercises. It is only when he feels this world has come to fruition that he adds the script which is the final layer. We feel this methodology is the most effective way to achieve a raw truthfulness on the delicate subject of grief.//However, to make the process more organic there will be no conventional script in our production, but will develop speech through a series of events using the 5 stages of grief.","risks and challenges":"We have our rehearsals booked and our venue ready to go, we're even coming up in The Unity Theatre's lovely little 'what's on guide,' but we don't have any money!

The story follows three teenagers - Lika, Marat and Leonidik - who survive the savage winter siege of Leningrad, 1942, losing everything from their past but gaining each other. Together, they find a new love which unites them, and a new hope which keeps them alive; the promise of a better future.A Little Bit About Us..Those two friends we mentioned are us, Eleri and Laura, and we are the co-directors of the brand spanking new theatre company Equapoise Theatre. The boring bit; Eleri was awarded a First Class Honours Degree in Drama and Screen Studies at the University of Manchester before training on Drama Centre London's two year Screen Acting Programme. Laura did her undergraduate degree in Business Studies before deciding to pursue theatre, achieving a diploma in Musical Theatre and a Masters in Advanced Theatre Practice from The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Between us we have several years of performance and production experience, ranging from events such as the Llangollen International Music Eisteddfod, Insight Film Festival, and a variety of Arts festivals in the UK and Ireland.We decided to form Equapoise Theatre as a means of creating our own opportunities alongside providing platforms for other emerging artists to showcase what they can do. As you probably know, starting out in the Arts Industry is far from easy, especially because of the competition for scarce funding from well established companies. However, we think the best way to counteract the challenges the industry can present is to create work we are passionate about through a collaborative ethos, and hopefully inspire others to join us in our efforts. We also intend to take our projects outside London as, although travelling incurs costs and presents challenges, more needs to be done to support and encourage regional theatre. We hope to reach young people and new audiences in the way that we were originally inspired as young creatives, in our home towns of Chester and Galway, which is why we are taking The Promise to Manchester and teaming up with The Boathouse in Barking. It's difficult to be unique and original without gimmicks, which is why with us, what you see is what you get, and we hope that our backgrounds and experiences, and those of our colleagues, will come together to make exciting work that challenges and reaches a national audience. That's enough about us. The Promise So Far..Since Equapoise was formed in February, we have been busy assembling a team of people who are genuinely fantastic at what they do, and its already been an exciting and challenging journey. You'll meet some of the team on our video, but here's a full cast/crew list if you want to check out our individual stories.CrewDirector - Daniel Ward GarberProducers - Laura Marie Donnelly & Eleri JonesDesigner - Isabella Van BraeckelProduction Assistant - Hollie HalesCast Lika - Eleri JonesMarat - Tony EcclesLeonidik - Theo St. ClaireWe've secured three great venues, established the company and launched our monthly new writing night since we started, so things have been pretty busy! Week 1 of rehearsals is over, our marketing campaign is in full swing and this brings us on to the matter of our Kickstarter campaign.What We Need The Money For..We have been lucky enough so far to draw on a small number of favours from people we've worked with previously and some new friends who have become as passionate as we are about this project. We have secured four weeks of free rehearsal space, thanks to Drama Centre London and The Boathouse, Barking who have agreed to become our first sponsor. We are extremely pleased with where we are so far, and have utilised as many resources as we can through sheer time and effort. All the creatives involved are working willingly for free in order to pool the small amount of finances we have into realising the project in its fullest capacity. Personal investment has covered some of our expenses incurred so far in our advertising, and we intend to cover the costs of each venue through the box office revenue.  For this project to fulfill its full potential, we need your support. We still have to cover the costs of;/Travel for the cast/crew to Manchester/Transporting the set and props to Manchester and Barking/Lighting Design/Sound Design/Authentic Costumes and Props/The Copyright for the text/Possible extension to other venues who have declared interest/We fully appreciate how difficult it can be to choose where to invest your hard earned money, but if our work sounds like something you'd like to support and be part of, anything you can give will be gratefully received. This will be the first of many projects for Equapoise Theatre so there will be more opportunities in the future for collaboration, but those who helped us start our journey will not be forgotten!","risks and challenges":"As with any artistic/financial endeavor, there will undoubtedly be challenges that arise through the risks we are taking in order to pull this project off. Here are some of the potential obstacles we anticipate;/- We will be able to cover our venue costs by selling half capacity at concessionary price in each venue, but we want to be able to give complimentary tickets to industry professionals who might be able to help us take this play even further. As you can never predict how well a show will sell, this is a risk on our part, and we have prepared for this potential outcome by factoring in some leftover budget in case we don't reach the intended ticket sales. If this doesn't happen, the money will be carried forward into our next project as we would rather look forward than keep wages/profit./- We have already faced the challenge of overcoming artistic differences with some people who we had hoped to work with on the project, but eventually agreed that our visions and perspectives were too different to continue. It wasn't easy to reach these decisions, but we have learnt along the way how best to handle such situations and now will be sure to emphasise that we expect collaboration to be at the heart of everyone's attitude to the work. If this were to happen again, our experiences and gut instincts can be trusted to help us move forward in a positive way that best serves the work we are creating./- With every live stage performance, there are any number of things that can go wrong each night, from sound and lighting cues to misbehaving props, costumes and set! We are confident that with our professional training backing us up, and the combined experience of dealing with all sorts of unpredictable problems, we will be able to keep calm and carry on, without these setbacks proving detrimental to the performance./- We have some tight turn around times for getting in and out of each venue, not to mention the transportation of everyone and everything between venues, and only a small team of individuals to make this happen. With travelling comes potential delays, particularly on the roads around London! We have therefore tried to pre-plan our timings to make each experience as relaxed with time as possible and allow for any delays that we might face. We will also be rehearsing the get in and out for the venues as much as we are the text!/If there's anything else, feel free to check out our website and get in touch, we'd love to hear from you!/Learn about accountability on

We would love to see this show move further, being picked up by a larger theatre with a larger production budget, so we want to give the best impression possible.

We would hate to have to compromise any element of this project. /Without our marketing budget funded, we may not even see the type of turnout we would have originally seen.

Children's Play: Romeo & Juliet Separated by War","info":{"description":"We need your help to fund this Syrian children's play! My dear friend, Nawar Bulbul, is a Syrian actor and humanitarian. In 2014, Nawar worked with Syrian children displaced by conflict in the Zaatari Refugee camp in Jordan to put on ‘Shakespeare in Zaatari’. Nawar has one objective: To humanize and inspire the children through art. To use art as an outlet for their anger, sorrow, and pain. Acting becomes a place to create meaning and inspiration through creative expression (read about the impact Shakespeare had on their lives).He's at it again with ROMEO & JULIET WITH A UNIQUE TWIST! Seeing the impact and joy that the play brought the Syrian children, Nawar is creating Syrian Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet are lovers. However, they are separated. Romeo lives in Amman Jordan, and his lover—Juliet—lives in a city inside Syria. The young boy who plays Romeo is an orphaned war amputee having lost his legs before fleeing Syria to seek safety in Amman, Jordan. Juliet is a young girl trapped in a besieged city in Syria cut off from resources, humanitarian support, and her extended family. This is their story of love, longing and childhood. Please help us make this a reality and help us share the beautiful stories of Syrian children with the world. Please note the fundraising goal is $7,000, however I set it at $4,000 as we will not get funding unless we meet the goal.THE BACKGROUND STORY: RESTORING CHILDHOOD THROUGH THE ARTS/In 2014, Syrian Actor/Nawar Bulbul (famous for his role in the popular show Bab Al-Hara) worked with/Syrian children displaced by conflict in the Zaatari Refugee camp in Jordan to/put on ‘Shakespeare in Zaatari’ [Read/more about the production in the New York Times]./The production took/many months to curate and featured 100 children in the cast, handmade costumes,/and a narrative of tragedy all too familiar to these war affected children..///Teaching the children about theatre//////Rehearsals in the refugee camp//////Play time in Amman, Jordan Ampitheatre//////A full house watching Shakespeare in Zaatari!///Bulbul says that psychologically and morally, theater is a way “to bring back laughter, joy, and humanity.” And despite extremely limited resources, he has helped eighty small and dedicated performers and singers find a public voice and platform from which to speak to the world. Nawar's objective is simple: To humanize and inspire the children through art. Arts/became an outlet for their anger, sorrow, and pain. Acting became a place to/create meaning and inspiration through creative expression. Through acting, the/children were able to create a new reality—they were now actors, not merely ‘refugees’.The creative space brought the children over/the course of months, creating a community to express their childhood and move/away from politics and hurt./The performance/debuted in the refugee camp to parents, guests and other children. A public/performance was later held in the old amphitheatre in Jordan’s capital, Amman. /ROMEO & JULIET WITH A TWIST/Seeing the impact and/joy that the play brought the Syrian children, Nawar Bulbul, has decided to now/create Romeo and Juliet. This play has a unique twist!/Romeo and Juliet are/lovers. However, in the Syrian rendition, they are separated. Romeo lives in/Amman Jordan, and his lover—Juliet—lives in a city inside Syria (location will not be revealed to protect the/security of those involved).  /The young boy who/plays Romeo is an orphaned war amputee having lost his legs before fleeing Syria to seek/safety in Amman, Jordan. Juliet is a young girl trapped in a besieged city in/Syria cut off from resources, humanitarian support, and her extended family. /To emphasis the separation,/anxiety and pain a lot of children face from being separated from their/childhood memories, families and their county, the play will use Skype and/online tools as the main means of communication between Romeo and Juliet. Using technology and skype is a creative way to also illustrate separation of many children from thier families. Skype is integrated fully into the play as they speak to each other and express their love through cameras./It is a story of love./Of passion. Of separation. And of longing. Romeo cannot wait to return to his/loves, Juliet and Syria. /The play will be/streamed to audiences online and via video. The play will debut on March 27, 2015 -- World Theater Day.///Rehearsals have begun!////HERE/IS WHERE YOU COME IN:/We are trying to raise $7,000 USD to pay for the following://Internet/Computer equipment & Basic technology tools (Skype subscriptions)/Transportation for production team/Videography and video editing/Photography /Toys and gifts for children and the families involved//PROJECT/MANAGEMENT/This is a grassroots project and is tied to no political, religious/or social groups. The entire initiative is currently self funded by Nawar with/in-kind support from friends and family./I personally met Nawar (the director and brain behind the/whole thing) on a recent trip Amman, Jordan on my way to visit Zaatari Refugee/camp for a project I was working on. We since became close friends and I am now/helping serve as a partner to him to help get him, his projects, and the/beautiful children of Syria get the funding and visibility they deserve. Arts/and cultural engagement is important not only for the morale of the children,/but also to help highlight the humanity of innocent children impacted by war,/with hopes to get more funding to support their mental health and education.PLEASE DONATE WHAT YOU CAN. SHARE THE LINK AND STORY WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. HELP NAWAR NOT ONLY INSPIRE THESE CHILDREN, BUT ALSO HELP THEM EXPERIENCE THE JOYS OF THEATRE AND ACTING. THEY DESERVE THEIR CHILDHOOD.Please note, I set the fundraising goal much lower as Kickstarter does not give you money if you fall short of your goal. Kindly help us reach our $7,000 goal.THANK YOU!","risks and challenges":"The potential risks involved include security of children and ability to have reliable internet connection. /Nawar and the entire support team are very sensitive to these issues and have very strong knowledge of all the related potential issues and how to overcome them./As for reliability of internet, we are working to purchase internet air time, and will also use an updated computer and camera to ensure quality./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"syrian-children-play-romeo-and-juliet-separated-by","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"4090.0","backers_count":48,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":1692919,"background_color":null,"project_id":1692919,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1425915893,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/030/751/a70b0d23203b2cf7fd6f6406d235cc7a_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463725580&auto=format&q=92&s=35f12c801967e46b6b5638c3f005a734","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/030/751/a70b0d23203b2cf7fd6f6406d235cc7a_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463725580&auto=format&q=92&s=35f12c801967e46b6b5638c3f005a734"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"A creative art therapy project for Syrian children.

That was until we signed the dotted line with company Empty Deck, who it turned out didn't make movies, oh no no no, they made theatre. So, this “Empty Deck”, they now need your help to raise £3,500 to get our show Cosmic Fear or The Day Brad Pitt Got Paranoia to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this August, all in the name of saving planet earth. /////  Who are EMPTY DECK?We’ve been working together since 2014, and we collaborate with artists and playwrights from around the world to make invigorating theatre that is relevant, daring, and international in reach.We’re one of the New Diorama Theatre’s Graduate Emerging Companies for 2016 having sold out at two Incoming Festivals; we’re Associate Artists at The Other Room in Cardiff; and we were shortlisted for the Peter Brook Award for Emerging Company in 2015, for our ‘stunningly performed and deftly directed’ Then Silence. We still have no idea how Brad found us, but he did and we’re in pretty deep now./ We’ve been working with him to make a multimedia show with lots of big projection (because Brad wanted his face “as big and beautiful as the moon”). Brad likes to call it ‘The Great Universal Love Project’ and its aim is big: to galvanise global consciousness to save the planet before it heats up too much, too quickly./We have a big and proudly international team on the show. See full biographies here and names below://///To make Cosmic Fear so far we've had the kind support of the Danish Embassy, A Younger Theatre, and Room One, the makers of the virtual reality headsets and installations you may have seen at Wonder.Land at the National Theatre. Room One have been extremely generous in providing us with valuable rehearsal space, technical expertise, equipment and other in-kind resources. Now though we need your support to guarantee our show getting up to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer - the largest theatre festival in the world. We need to ensure Brad Pitt doesn’t bankrupt us. He’s very demanding./Please do read on for more info or check out what our Brad Pitts have to say in the video above. Have a look at the glamorous perks on the right. Your contribution - large or small - will be hugely appreciated and go a long way in helping us to resurrect Brad’s career and Save Planet Earth!/Thank you for reading.  ///Preview performance, Incoming Festival, New Diorama, July 3rd 2016///LA is filled with traffic jams under heavy smog, trees are drifting under floods in Bangladesh and in China incinerators are burning holes in the ozone layer. Brad Pitt fears the future. /But Brad is a man of action; he’s not just here to entertain, he's here to make a difference./Paralyzed by the coming “Ecocalypyse” - or “Greenhouse-hell” - three flat-mates are left with only one thing they can do: embody Brad Pitt and make the ultimate blockbuster that can transform the consciousness of the entire world and Save Planet Earth! /Cosmic Fear or The Day Brad Pitt Got Paranoia is written by the award-winning Danish playwright Christian Lollike. It marks the anxious unravelling of a mind through three characters as it ruminates on the relentlessly changing climate, and the West's inaction to undo the planet’s devastation.  This is Christian Lollike's UK premiere.///Christian Lollike is also the Artistic Director of the SORT/HVID theatre in Copenhagen. We love what they do...\"We challenge your opinions and feelings, and we take you places where uncertainty is the reference point\"/// /Directed by Kay Michael (2016 JMK Award Finalist), Cosmic Fear or The Day Brad Pitt Got Paranoia is an absurd multimedia comedy tackling our powerlessness in the face of ever-escalating environmental disaster.  /The show is performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival from 3rd – 28th August at 3pm. We're performing at Bedlam Theatre, winner of the Edinburgh Sustainability Bronze Award and recipient of the :entertaining sustainability Award for Venue Sustainability in 2013./ We're proud to continue a shared vision of building a greener world with Bedlam./The Edinburgh Festival is the platform we need for our company’s debut production run, from which we plan to book a nationwide and international tour in 2017./More Than A Show: Cosmic Outreach/Brad was adamant that we couldn’t just do a funny and ironic show about trying to save the planet. That would be mere posturing. We’d also have to organise events and activities that would galvanise people into taking action, in a positive and fun way. //Working in close association with climate change psychologist Dr Stuart Capstick of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, and with the support of The Vegan Society and various Edinburgh-based environmental groups, we’ve constructed a programme called ‘Cosmic Outreach’, running alongside our production of Cosmic Fear./Our planned events include:/- A Vegan & Veggie Food Tour of the city with an accompanying treasure map//- A Woodlands Workshop with Green Aspirations//- 'Cosmic Cafes’ held in the Bedlam Theatre cafe. These are open forum discussions led by climate psychologists and speakers from GoVeg Scotland. /- /‘Cosmic Commune’ – an opportunity to picnic and connect with the Empty Deck and Cosmic Fear team in the beautiful surroundings of the Meadows, and partake in an afternoon of performance poetry.///\"The majority of people, across the world, already accept that climate change is a major threat and might be prepared to support the necessary changes. They currently feel isolated and powerless, but could readily be mobilised if their concerns and hopes became validated within a community of shared conviction and purpose.\" (George Marshall)/Where your money will be invested/Creating a new show costs a lot of money; it’s unfortunate but true./Your support will provide the final gloss on the production ready for a month long run at Bedlam Theatre as well as our wider outreach programme.// A small amount can go a really long way in ensuring we can get to Edinburgh in one piece, sleep easy at night and feed our hungry mouths. /Your money will go towards the following://•\tProps and set. We need to hire a quality projector as well as make a huge projection screen to finish our set for the Edinburgh run.//•\tTravel and Accommodation. This includes our own travel costs to and from Edinburgh, and a flat large enough to house 3 happy actors, 1 highly organised stage manager, and a revolving team of Empty Deck producers and creatives. That’s 8 people in total for the month.//•\tMarketing. A portion of this money will contribute to flyers, posters and other promotional material. Bedlam Theatre is in a prime position next to Bristo Square, but its capacity is high; an audience of 90. We’re determined to fill those seats. But with thousands of other shows to compete against, our marketing campaign and promotional material becomes vital to our success.//•\tWoodland activities. As part of our ‘Climate Outreach’ we’re partnering with Green Aspirations to hold a workshop of woodland activities in the greenlands of Scotland, and we need to hire transport to get groups of people outside of urban Edinburgh and into nature. /Green Aspirations are a woodland based social enterprise who teach traditional crafts and rural skills, from woodland management to whittling. They aim to encourage and inspire a new generation to care for their environment, and we’re thrilled to be working them. /To make the above possible we need to raise at least £3,500...//////Any donation you can give will play a huge part in getting the project to where it needs to be. /Alternatively, if you don't feel able to help financially, that's OK. /Follow us on Twitter, Like us on Facebook, check out our website, share this campaign, and book to see the show in Edinburgh. /Helping us spread the word is half the battle! (Brad is used to global film markets…)/ ////Photo taken by The Other Richard, Incoming Festival 2016///“No play has, or since, embraced the unpredictability of theatre with such schizophrenic dynamism” - Dean Hodge, Freelance Journalist and Reviewer, on Cosmic Fear (scratch performance) at The Other Room //////“Brilliantly directed… Explosive and dynamic…. Certainly want to see more” - Theatre Bubble, on Then Silence  ////// “Terrifying and engulfing” - Exeunt Magazine, on Then Silence /‘Kay Michael has created a non-stop, thrilling physical version of this frightening, intelligent play’ - Andrew Haydon, Postcards from the Gods, on Then Silence/ “Empty Deck is one of the most forward looking and distinct companies I have seen in recent years.”  - Simon Usher, Theatre Director/Thanks so much for reading and we hope you're excited by what we're up to! Please support in any way you can./Team Cosmic Fear x","risks and challenges":"The biggest risk at the Edinburgh Fringe is always not getting enough bums on seats./In 2015 alone there were 2 million tickets issued at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, so we know that it's a beast of a festival, and there's no hard and fast rule for having a successful run whilst up there - it's competitive./However, we have a large, passionate and experienced team delivering and promoting Cosmic Fear, and have already built up strong partners embedded in the Edinburgh community who share our vision and are working to promote what we're doing through our Cosmic Outreach. These range from our vegetarian and vegan vendors to academics from the Edinburgh University. /On top of this, Bedlam is unique in its commitment to its selected programme of shows. Bedlam has been named one of The Guardian’s Top 10 Performance Venues in Edinburgh and has a loyal fanbase. Being a venue with only one stage, it has a limited amount of productions on every day, so the particular attention and support we'll get from their team will give Cosmic Fear a definitive boost.  Its location on the corner of Bristo Square makes it stand out amongst the other \"Big Venues\" and is a stone's throw away from the famous Royal Mile where we'll be pulling in our punters via our street publicity stunts. /Our Brads have big personalities so we're sure to make this a hit amongst the crowd. Empty Deck also has various associate companies and artists working across the festival, such as Presence Theatre, and together we're determined to build an audience for bold new international theatre./Learn about accountability on

Vidal's THE BEST MAN, by Seat of the Pants Productions","info":{"description":"For the past three years, Seat of the Pants Productions has been mounting innovative theatrical projects with the generous support of the Kickstarter community.You first donated $6500 to help us mount a critically-acclaimed production of God of Carnage, the proceeds from which were used to help raise awareness in local schools to issues around bullying and teen suicide.Next, you bravely supplied $6300 to underwrite the completely original and unique Frankenstein: The Puppet Opera, which was locally composed, orchestrated, played and sung, and then brought to live by local artists and puppeteers who built and operated every object and character seen onstage. Three years in the making - and you were part of it.Last summer, you marshaled $4500 to get Seat of the Pants situated in our new permanent home at The Black Box Theatre in GlenOak High School. Our sold-out performances of Picnic allowed us to start building an organizational savings account that is enabling us to move toward financial independence as we ponder future summer seasons at The Black Box.Because of last summer's success and several received grants, we're only looking to raise $1750 this year for a project about which we're very excited. And we've got just 20 days to do it!Written and premiering on Broadway in 1960, Gore Vidal's Tony-nominated political satire, THE BEST MAN is still witty and prophetic  against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election. The play pits William Russell against Joe Cantwell as they both vie for their party's nomination during a contested convention. The battle for delegates finds both men courting a countrified former president for his endorsement, managing crises with their respective wives, and fielding increasingly corrupt suggestions from their campaign managers.Skewering both the left and the right, offering biting critiques of how we \"do\" politics, and raising important questions about character and ethics, THE BEST MAN is sure to be more entertaining than tuning into the actual news.And since art imitating life is always more fun, we're mounting the production July 29-31 and August 5-7, right in the middle of this year's Republican and Democratic National Conventions.We're grateful - as ever - for the support you've shown us along the way, and covet your help again as we strive to bring relevant and exciting theatre to life.Please give at any level you're able and - regardless - please join us for the show. Tickets can be purchase at seatofthepants.eventbrite.com.Thanks so much! ","risks and challenges":"The risks and challenges of this project are fewer than in past years. We've already obtained the rights to perform the show; we now have a year under our belts in a new space that posed some initial challenges; we've proven ourselves several times now in producing quality theater from nothing, and we're moving toward financial independence and solubility. In short, we' ready for whatever comes at us!/Learn about accountability on

Hat","info":{"description":"Three years ago, on a blustery weekend on the Washington coast, several friends sat around talking about dating stories. One story got the most laughs and caused the most conversation and thus The Hat was born.Admit it, everyone has a story about a date that went bad. Some of those stories make it to advice columns like The Bitter Single Guy. The stories are funny, weirder than real life, and clear heroes and villains. Some of these stories inspired the totally made-up, 100% fictitious, events in The Hat.The Hat has stories about dates gone bad, but there are no clear heroes or villains. Just guys trying to make a connection. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they fail. Miserably.Roy Antonio Arauz will be directing an awesome cast: Adam Minton plays Kevin who is looking for love; Charles Waxberg plays the witty Gordon, Jeff Church plays Peter in his mid-life crisis, Eric Olson plays the dashing Markus, Clayton Michael plays the loyal Andrew, and Buddy Todd plays Travis as well as one half of several bad dates. The all-star, all-female design team includes regular collaborators Kim Rosin for set design, Zanna Paulson in lights and Dana Amronin for sound; and the fantastic Natasha Gier takes the costuming reigns. Our Stage Manager will be the amazing David Rodriguez-Jenkins. Additionally, this event will be co-produced by Gay City Health Project.We are thrilled to bring this fun tale to you in April of 2016 at Calamus Auditorium on Seattle's Capitol Hill. ","risks and challenges":"Producing new work is very exciting. This is the first step in what could be a long road. And it’s also very risky. There is no preconceived notion on what the show is about. How to entice people to attend? The show needs an audience to grow, develop and mature. Thus the risk is our challenge: get the show produced, get people to see it./To produce The Hat, aside from our time, expenses include: performance venue rental, rehearsal space rental, costumes, sets, properties, sound design, actor stipends, and last but definitely not least, advertising. Advertising includes posters, cards, website, newspaper and online ads. Is your head spinning yet? All this adds up, and it’s why we would love your support./We are committed to being fiscally responsible when producing the play. Our collaboration with Gay City Health Project has helped us reduce venue rental fees, and we only put on stage what is necessary.

The reading will be produced in accordance with Actor's Equity Association Stage Reading Guidelines.  The reading is planned for mid-January, 2015. Funds raised through this Kickstarter Project will help ensure Off-Broadway theater rental, payment for actors, and other small necessary expenses such as programs and minimal advertisement. The main goal is to gain exposure for the play, as well as provide the playwright a platform to hear the play read by seasoned actors and make rewrites accordingly in preparation for a full production.Brief SynopsisAnother school shooting has occurred in the US, this time in Texas. The teenaged shooter, Connor Stephens, is hospitalized from attempted suicide. The one victim was Tess Williamson, the adopted daughter of a gay couple — Jim and Kris.  //On the day of the funeral in the midst of national media attention, family members arrive at the home of Jim and Kris to pay their respects. Attendees include Jim's estranged parents, Big Jim and Marianne, and grandmother, Vivi'n. Big Jim, a radical Baptist preacher, is determined to use the current situation as a way of “saving” his son from what he considers to be a life of sin — until it is revealed that Big Jim may be responsible for the death of Tess. //In this intimate family drama, religious beliefs, consequences of actions, and extreme loss shake the families to the core as they struggle to come to terms with the tragedy that has occurred.","risks and challenges":"If this project is successfully funded, we believe there will be little risk involved in producing the reading. Casting the appropriate actors, given that a number of the performers have older age requirements, could be challenging. But with proper audition notices and agent contacts, this should be easily overcome./Learn about accountability on Kickstarter"},"slug":"professional-play-reading-the-crusade-of-connor-st","source_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/theater/plays?ref=category_modal&sort=magic","usd_pledged":"2000.0","backers_count":15,"profile":{"blurb":null,"id":1499154,"background_color":null,"project_id":1499154,"background_image_opacity":0.8,"should_show_feature_image_section":true,"link_background_color":null,"state_changed_at":1425915882,"state":"inactive","show_feature_image":false,"text_color":null,"link_text":null,"link_url":null,"name":null,"feature_image_attributes":{"image_urls":{"baseball_card":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/937/379/792b346c90356a41a607787bbef753a1_original.png?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463718323&auto=format&q=92&s=c35fa9e204e4357ef68a6ef74fda17b0","default":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/937/379/792b346c90356a41a607787bbef753a1_original.png?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1463718323&auto=format&q=92&s=c35fa9e204e4357ef68a6ef74fda17b0"}},"link_text_color":null},"blurb":"An Equity Reading of a new play;
